00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.361
["The Vanishing American Family"  by ScubaZ]

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:16.837
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology began with a promise.

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:21.331
A promise that with a devotion to technology,

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:23.735
through rigorous study of math and science,

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.504
we can engineer a better tomorrow.

00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:27.599
we can make

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.000
a Better World.

00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:35.347
In this story,

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:37.242
we ask a simple question.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:40.283
Have we kept our promise?

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:10.121
MIT was founded in 1861.

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:13.448
But the Institute as we know it today was born in 1941.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.448
December 7th, 1941.
