00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.093
_

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:17.083
The <i>Massachusetts Institute of
Technology</i> began with a promise

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:22.036
A promise that with a
devotion to technology,

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:26.064
through vigorous study of math and science,
we can engineer a better tomorrow,

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.027
we can make a better world.

00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:41.004
In this story, we ask a simple
question, Have we kept our promise?

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:13.078
MIT was founded in 1861, but the institute
as we know it today, was born in 1941,

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:40.021
December 7th, 1941. No matter how long
it may take us to overcome this premeditated

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:54.062
invasion, the American people in their
righteous mic will win through to absolute.

00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:04.064
Once news of the attack on Pearl Harbor
reached the student body campus was in and

00:02:04.064 --> 00:02:08.076
uproar, students prepared
to drop out in droves,

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:10.056
ready to enlist in military service.

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:15.092
Worried about the mass exodus
of students from campus.

00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:18.044
President Compton urged students
to finish their degrees.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:23.040
If students were desperate to answer
the call to arms, then MIT would front line.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.064
MIT was well positioned to support the
war effort having recently solved everything

00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:42.092
there is to know about boats from
Pearl Harbor to the end of the war,

00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:45.040
United States would build
nearly 6,000 ships.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.032
But building the most dominant nav force
the world had ever seen was simply not

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:57.028
enough. President Roosevelt had declared
total war and any hope that the

00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:00.036
United States had of winning relied
on mobilizing industrial potential of the

00:03:00.036 --> 00:03:00.536
nation.

00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:11.060
The US military needed MIT to develop
fundamentally new technology and the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.020
institute administrators recognized as
opportunity, namely President Compton and

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.044
his colleague Boniva Bush, who
is Dean of Engineering at the time.

00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:23.092
Vannevar Bush was a brilliant American
engineer, born of a long line of

00:03:23.092 --> 00:03:29.032
Massachusetts boatman in 1915, having
already invented a novel surveyor tool.

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:33.048
Bush enrolled as a grad student at MIT
and during the PhD in electrical engineering

00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:34.036
in only nine months.

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:39.012
He began teaching at MIT in 1919 and
extended his track record of innovation.

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:44.048
First Bush developed Rectifier Tube,
which radically simplified home radio and

00:03:44.048 --> 00:03:46.020
started a company called
Raytheon, The Market.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.068
His device, one of his proudest inventions,
was an analog computer for solving

00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:53.020
higher order differential equations.

00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:57.012
Bush was quoted saying that the
computer represented an ideal,

00:03:57.058 --> 00:04:00.012
the ability to think straight
in the midst of complexity.

00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:01.056
During

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:05.044
World War ii, the Defense Department
would run Bush's computer 24 hours a day.

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.048
Bush

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:12.060
Would go on to lead long and esteemed
life advocating federal supportive scientific

00:04:12.088 --> 00:04:14.024
research and technological advancement.

00:04:14.043 --> 00:04:17.056
Ultimately leading to the creation
of the National Science Foundation.

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:22.020
Bush's are sent for from academia, began
with the immense opportunity that World

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.024
War II provided. He moved his career
from MIT to the White House as Chief Science

00:04:26.024 --> 00:04:29.096
advisor to President Roosevelt, managing
all defense contracts and spearheading the

00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:31.076
creation of the National
Defense Research Committee.

00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:36.076
President Compton, a founding
member of the ndrc,

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:38.064
continued to serve as MIT president.

00:04:38.064 --> 00:04:44.016
Aligning the institute with the Warrior
Compton was an impressive man as well,

00:04:44.048 --> 00:04:46.036
installed as president of the Institute.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:50.032
At the dawn of the Great Depression,
he faced an anti-scientific culture and a

00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:53.020
financially crippled mit, an idealist.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:57.044
He overhauled MIT's engineering
curriculum and infused the sense Vigo,

00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:58.044
it still known for today.

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.080
He sought an education system in science
and engineering that could propel the

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.032
nation forward.

00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:08.080
And he later shaped other colleges in
the institute's image as the head of multiple

00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:12.020
accreditation boards. Once
World War II broke out,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.004
he was tasked with the most precious
need of the US defense strategy rubber.

00:05:16.095 --> 00:05:21.044
With Southeast Asia, our prime rubber
supplier now cut off from the allies the US

00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:23.044
scrambled for new sources
of the strategic material.

00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:27.096
President Roosevelt appointed President
Compton and other scientific leaders to

00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:30.032
quickly develop a strategy
for synthetic production.

00:05:30.085 --> 00:05:34.024
It was the first test in just one month.

00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:37.072
The taskforce built and connected
51 factories across the country.

00:05:38.006 --> 00:05:41.056
The success solidified MIT as an
important gear in the warm machine.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.012
The war effort consumed MIT
and MIT consumed the war.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:55.056
It's fair to say that to enroll at MIT
was to enlist in the technological branch of

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:56.044
the US Armed Forces.

00:05:57.004 --> 00:05:59.068
MIT's RAD lab built the first
deployable radar machines.

00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:00.096
Professor

00:06:00.096 --> 00:06:04.084
Charles Stark Draper's instrumentation
lab developed inertial navigation systems

00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:08.048
critical to ships, tanks, planes,
and virtually everything that move.

00:06:10.084 --> 00:06:15.048
Professor Edgerton pioneered high speed
photography critical for Connaissance and

00:06:15.048 --> 00:06:16.096
ultimately making D-Day possible.

00:06:49.032 --> 00:06:50.070
The war was won in Europe.

00:06:54.034 --> 00:06:57.066
Electricity was no longer bashing and
Killian Quartz lights could come back on.

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:03.078
Took a memory. At VE day, the institute
celebrated in the only way it knew how by

00:07:03.078 --> 00:07:05.094
hosting a science fair showing off.

00:07:05.094 --> 00:07:08.025
All the technology developed
during those few short years,

00:07:44.084 --> 00:07:49.054
but there was still one more enemy,
and MIT had one more lap to fight it.

00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:11.060
With all of the projects
successfully completed,

00:08:12.008 --> 00:08:14.084
institute students and faculty
flock to Los Alamos.

00:08:14.084 --> 00:08:27.016
In an effort to bear the, the
RAD Lab completely shut down.

00:08:27.035 --> 00:08:28.068
Emptying itself flows.

00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:35.015
Alamos, every department sent its best
electrical engineers, physicists, chemists,

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:40.091
and even photographers came together for
their ultimate creation, pure destruction.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.083
He knew the world would not be the same.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.031
Few people laughed, few people cried.

00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:21.066
Most people were silent.

00:09:25.034 --> 00:09:29.014
I remembered the line
from the Indu scripture.

00:09:29.014 --> 00:09:42.038
The Bible, Adi this knew, was trying
to persuade the prince that he should do his

00:09:42.038 --> 00:09:50.095
duty and to impress him, takes
on his multi-armed form and says,

00:09:51.097 --> 00:09:53.035
Now I am become deaf.

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:55.059
The destroyer of worlds.

00:09:58.062 --> 00:10:00.099
I suppose we all thought
that one way or another.

00:10:01.014 --> 00:10:03.079
Hello, I'm John Fitch,
MIT Science Reporter.

00:10:03.095 --> 00:10:07.059
We're at the home of Dr. Vannevar
Bush in Belmont, Massachusetts.

00:10:07.094 --> 00:10:12.005
He shared the enormous responsibility
for the development and use of our most

00:10:12.005 --> 00:10:14.005
fearsome weapon, the atomic bomb.

00:10:14.017 --> 00:10:15.037
Let's meet Dr. Bush.

00:10:15.084 --> 00:10:21.049
Well, of course my first reaction was
one of great relief that the program had been

00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:23.088
successful and the bomb
had gone off on a schedule.

00:10:24.063 --> 00:10:28.040
Well, now when you go look back
from a vantage point of 18 years, uh,

00:10:28.053 --> 00:10:30.005
do you have any regrets about it?

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:34.037
No. Of course, President Truman
made the decision to use the bomb,

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.069
but I thought then, and I
think now that he was right

00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:58.015
After successfully conquering
the planet in the second World War.

00:13:58.047 --> 00:14:05.024
Life at MIT was peaceful, almost bucolic
word spread of MIT's decisive role in the

00:14:05.024 --> 00:14:08.028
war and its prestige balloon
as its acceptance rate rank.

00:14:11.047 --> 00:14:15.039
A focus on an enhanced student life emerged
with ample funding for student groups,

00:14:15.047 --> 00:14:17.044
recreation, and additional dorms.

00:14:18.086 --> 00:14:22.044
The institute would be unrecognizable
to a student from just 10 years prior.

00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:25.080
MIT had become a popular
kid with powerful friends.

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:44.039
This was made possible by MIT's now permanent
wartime friends, the d o d, the cia,

00:14:44.074 --> 00:14:46.063
and countless private
military contractors.

00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:49.060
Butcher own Athia was chief amongst them.

00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:56.015
Former GIS returned to a greatly expanded
MIT living in highly experimental west

00:14:56.015 --> 00:14:59.063
campus housing, replete with solar panels
and other cutting edge innovations.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:03.100
With the Lewis report, the undergraduate
curriculum was overhauled.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.043
Once again. The report, which
was more of a proclamation,

00:15:07.067 --> 00:15:09.096
broke up the institute
into distinct schools.

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:17.088
Science, engineering, architecture planning,
and has coursework and humanities and

00:15:17.088 --> 00:15:21.088
social sciences was instituted as a
requirement for all undergraduates with no

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:34.060
exceptions. The report
also exposed an epidemic.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.084
Of course, Bibles compilations of
past exams and problem sets with answers

00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:46.012
included. A radical demographic
shift was also underway.

00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:50.048
Over the course of the decade, the undergraduate
population of women grew by 50

00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:52.004
students.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:59.056
About 100 co-eds attend MIT and participate
in all aspects of student affairs.

00:15:59.086 --> 00:16:04.036
The girls have their own social rooms
in the main school building inside this door.

00:16:04.036 --> 00:16:10.029
It's strictly no men allowed Hear the
co-eds congregate between classes and relax

00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:12.092
from the pressure of class
work among other things.

00:16:13.004 --> 00:16:14.097
This is the girls' Communication Center.

00:16:15.038 --> 00:16:19.081
In typical feminine fashion, the girls
take time out to gossip about clothes and

00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:25.000
dates, exchange news, and congratulate
or sympathize with one another about their

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.077
grades. MIT co-eds are gifted musically
too and relax in this enjoyable manner.

00:16:30.088 --> 00:16:35.064
After finishing with gossiping and other
talk, when studying in the horizontal,

00:16:35.064 --> 00:16:38.005
one must be prepared to
accept this consequence.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:43.077
Here, the girls study in complete silence
and the signs of intense concentration

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:46.064
are evident well, most
of the time anyway.

00:16:46.077 --> 00:16:50.005
After all, the studious beaver
is also the social beaver.

00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:54.061
And what is more natural than planning
and daydreaming about that new evening gown.

00:16:56.058 --> 00:17:01.064
In 1955, the institute established the
Office of Minority Education to promote

00:17:01.064 --> 00:17:03.092
inclusion for the growing number
of Irish and Italian students.

00:17:05.009 --> 00:17:06.097
MIT's non-white population quickly grew.

00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:14.005
This family from the Philippines is a
reminder that MIT has the most cosmopolitan

00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:19.013
student body of any college or university
in the United States with nearly every

00:17:19.013 --> 00:17:20.049
country in the world represented.

00:17:21.027 --> 00:17:27.009
The core of MIT's success is its power
to vitalize its students hidden reserve of

00:17:27.009 --> 00:17:28.033
energy and imagination.

00:17:28.084 --> 00:17:33.024
This the classroom cannot do alone
for the social life of the student is the

00:17:33.045 --> 00:17:36.061
catalyst. MIT provides
all the ingredients needed.

00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:42.013
Our social beaver has rare extracurricular
opportunities and does indeed use them

00:17:42.013 --> 00:17:42.513
well.

00:18:11.013 --> 00:18:15.047
Before our story begins, let
<inaudible> setting for Boston,

00:18:15.047 --> 00:18:17.003
we see a of technology.

00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:21.038
MIT is best known for the scientists
and engineers who have studied there,

00:18:21.072 --> 00:18:25.047
but much of MIT's campus houses,
laboratories, and research project,

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.003
which provides a stimulating
practice for faculty and students.

00:18:29.028 --> 00:18:33.011
On the edge of the campus is the digital
Computer laboratory home of Project

00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:33.511
Whirlwind.

00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:38.047
In the late 1950s, MIT was at
the forefront of digital computing.

00:18:39.013 --> 00:18:44.018
Claude Shannon was pioneering information
theory introducing binary digits or bits

00:18:44.024 --> 00:18:45.038
to encode information.

00:18:48.005 --> 00:18:51.087
His colleague, Perry Crawford helped
develop whirlwind a state-of-the-art digital

00:18:52.022 --> 00:18:53.059
computer that became
the standard for all.

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:54.011
That followed

00:18:55.024 --> 00:18:59.083
The Amatic element where the Arithmetics
performed consists of 16 racks.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:04.001
Each rack handles one of the
16 binary digits rising of Word.

00:19:04.068 --> 00:19:08.088
Harry and Claw developed their work under
the mentorship of a shared advisor for

00:19:08.088 --> 00:19:18.020
Neva Bush. Other professors were also
hard at work, bolstering MIT's reputation.

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:25.005
Professors Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy
founded a groundbreaking computer

00:19:25.005 --> 00:19:28.040
science lab, and in the process coined
a term that would change the world.

00:19:28.091 --> 00:19:30.028
Artificial intelligence.

00:20:02.006 --> 00:20:03.004
Now, what are they doing?

00:20:03.004 --> 00:20:05.072
Showing the computer the
alphabet for the first time?

00:20:05.098 --> 00:20:06.040
Yes.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.072
In just the same way the teacher
did with a child letter.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.000
The longer the line, the
sure the computer is of its

00:20:16.063 --> 00:20:22.084
Answer's indicated that
bottom bar 80% sure.

00:20:23.007 --> 00:20:23.507
Pretty good.

00:20:24.042 --> 00:20:25.068
Now, do you call that learning?

00:20:26.055 --> 00:20:30.072
Well, I know that if my wife and I
saw our kids going through that process,

00:20:30.072 --> 00:20:31.072
we'd call it learning.

00:20:32.045 --> 00:20:34.052
So machines really can learn.

00:20:34.083 --> 00:20:36.096
With the Cold War simulating
in the background,

00:20:37.086 --> 00:20:41.060
MIT expanded it's pursuit of science
and engineering for a better world.

00:20:42.082 --> 00:20:45.096
Doc Draper's lab continued producing
guidance systems for the military

00:20:51.026 --> 00:20:54.080
and the Lincoln Laboratories were founded
to strengthen the link between MIT and

00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:02.064
the Department of Defense. Recruiting
pipelines were engineered from the institute

00:21:02.064 --> 00:21:06.012
to the cia, d o d and private
military contractors,

00:21:06.055 --> 00:21:09.080
ensuring government access to
MIT's most valuable resource.

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:18.092
Towards the end of the fifties, a satellite
Lincoln Labs detected something it had

00:21:18.092 --> 00:21:24.024
never detected before, something
no one had ever detected before.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:36.028
Medium range

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:37.505
Me

00:21:38.036 --> 00:21:40.032
Military buildup on the island of

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:48.016
Among the stars, like the

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:53.048
Purpose of these bases can be none
other Then to provide a nuclear strike

00:21:53.048 --> 00:22:00.028
capability against the Western Hemisphere,
we choose to go to the moon in this

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:02.004
decay and do the other thing

00:22:02.093 --> 00:22:05.052
To boldly go When no man has gone before,

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:12.064
Fill my heart with and let sing

00:22:14.058 --> 00:22:17.068
The apparently official President Kennedy

00:22:18.019 --> 00:22:19.056
Died at one.

00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:23.016
Shall Hannah overcome.

00:22:23.055 --> 00:22:24.064
Stop sweet talking.

00:22:25.015 --> 00:22:26.000
Tell him how.

00:22:26.086 --> 00:22:31.048
And let's to clean his house up.

00:22:33.013 --> 00:22:36.072
He shouldn't have a house
should catch on fire.

00:22:37.087 --> 00:22:38.048
Burned

00:23:12.067 --> 00:23:13.016
Fill

00:23:13.033 --> 00:23:14.084
My heart with song.

00:23:15.062 --> 00:23:17.068
Let me sing Forever

00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:47.060
In love

00:23:49.037 --> 00:23:50.056
In a nation's pledge.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.040
Now been fulfilled.

00:23:52.054 --> 00:23:54.056
The lunar age has begun.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.064
You, man.

00:23:58.064 --> 00:24:01.008
On the moon. Oh boy.

00:24:01.098 --> 00:24:06.004
Boy. We're gonna be busy for
a minute while they say something.

00:24:06.004 --> 00:24:06.504
I'm speechless.

00:24:14.056 --> 00:24:17.071
Hi. Uh, could I have
the um, noodle salad?

00:24:17.071 --> 00:24:20.031
Yes. With, uh, tofu as the protein?

00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:23.007
Yeah. And, uh, soy drizzle
as the dressing.

00:24:23.007 --> 00:24:24.015
Okay. Anything else?

00:24:24.032 --> 00:24:25.019
Uh, that's all.

00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:26.027
Okay, thank you.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.019
No problem.

00:24:34.051 --> 00:24:38.010
If you read through the campus newspaper
from all the years before World War ii,

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.070
you would think Yeah, an engineer
definitely wrote this.

00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:45.090
It is the most dry end dispassionate
newspaper I've ever read.

00:24:46.005 --> 00:24:50.062
It's barely more than a list of academic
deadlines and updates about how poorly the

00:24:50.082 --> 00:24:53.030
athletic teams are doing.
Uh, pretty boring stuff.

00:24:53.047 --> 00:24:55.038
Uh, but Pearl Harbor changes all that.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.050
You see, when there is a
national directive in place,

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.094
when resources and efforts
are consolidated,

00:25:01.094 --> 00:25:04.058
the institute really becomes impassioned.

00:25:04.058 --> 00:25:09.018
It finds its purpose, and in the 1960s,
that directive was the space rich.

00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:14.074
5 4 3, 2, 1 0.

00:25:15.016 --> 00:25:16.034
All engine runs.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:33.067
Today's big picture will reveal the dramatic
suspenseful story of how the army,

00:25:33.086 --> 00:25:38.043
when the Prestiges of the United States
throughout the world had been shaken by

00:25:38.043 --> 00:25:42.099
events beyond its control, stirred the
hearts and emotions of the American people

00:25:43.018 --> 00:25:46.091
with an epic display of scientific
and technical teamwork.

00:25:47.066 --> 00:25:52.063
When NASA began operations on October
1st, 1958, it already had connections to mit.

00:25:53.037 --> 00:25:56.083
MIT president, Dr. James Killian, was
serving a special assistant for science and

00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:58.035
technology to President Eisenhower.

00:25:58.076 --> 00:26:01.099
It was Dr. Killian who recommended
that the National Advisory Committee for

00:26:01.099 --> 00:26:05.031
Aeronautics be transformed to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.

00:26:05.076 --> 00:26:09.043
Several other notable figures from the
early years of NASA were MIT faculty and

00:26:09.043 --> 00:26:14.039
alumni. Professor Jerome c Hunsaker
served as chairman of NACA in the fifties,

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:18.035
Professor Rayman l Biling Hoff was
NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced

00:26:18.051 --> 00:26:21.087
Research and Technology. Professor Robert
Siemens served as deputy administrator.

00:26:21.094 --> 00:26:25.019
John McCarthy was the chief engineer
of the Space Systems Division at North

00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:28.079
American Aviation, the NASA contractor
that built the Apollo commanded service

00:26:28.079 --> 00:26:32.095
modules. Joseph g Gavin was president
of the Grumman Corporation and oversaw

00:26:32.095 --> 00:26:34.035
construction of Apollo's Luna Module.

00:26:38.018 --> 00:26:41.019
Many of the Apollo era astronauts
were also MIT alumni.

00:26:45.018 --> 00:26:49.003
Once formed, NASA began to innovate
at a pace that has never been seen by any

00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:49.503
institution since.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.063
Project Mercury kicked off in the first
days of NASA to probe the most fundamental

00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:56.023
questions associated with space travel.

00:26:56.089 --> 00:27:01.047
Its mission was to orbit a man spacecraft
around Earth to investigate how a human

00:27:01.047 --> 00:27:05.051
body functions in space, and to safely
return an astronaut and spacecraft to

00:27:05.051 --> 00:27:05.551
ground.

00:27:07.011 --> 00:27:10.083
After Alan, she became the second man
and first American to orbit the earth and

00:27:10.083 --> 00:27:14.067
return safely. President Kennedy announced
the directive of landing a man on the

00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:20.091
moon. 10 weeks later, the first major
contract of the Apollo program was awarded to

00:27:20.091 --> 00:27:23.027
NASA's older brother mit.

00:27:25.013 --> 00:27:27.059
The contract was for the navigation
and guidance system,

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:30.071
the autopilot that would get the
astronauts from Earth to Luna Orbit.

00:27:31.005 --> 00:27:35.019
The contract was awarded to the MIT
Instrumentation Lab led by Dr. Draper.

00:27:35.063 --> 00:27:38.027
Hello, I'm John Fitch, MIT Science.

00:27:38.027 --> 00:27:42.019
Before today, we're at the
MIT Instrumentation Laboratory,

00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:47.003
which has been given design responsibility
for this guidance and navigation system,

00:27:47.015 --> 00:27:51.047
which will direct our Apollo spacecraft
ons way to the Bulls facts.

00:27:52.032 --> 00:27:58.010
At one time, direction of the rising
sun rapid winding riverbed with all the fan

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.098
needed is restless search for new land.

00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:06.042
Today we speak of traversing a billion
miles of empty space where there is no

00:28:06.042 --> 00:28:11.070
north, no south, no rising, north
setting sun, not even any up or down.

00:28:12.025 --> 00:28:15.078
It's an extremely complicated
pass requiring many,

00:28:15.078 --> 00:28:18.042
many measurements and
billions of calculation.

00:28:18.056 --> 00:28:22.082
The guidance system operating at a 12
microsecond clock speed performed flawlessly

00:28:22.082 --> 00:28:24.002
through nine flights to the moon.

00:28:24.058 --> 00:28:27.046
Astronaut David, a Scott called
it a tremendous machine,

00:28:27.083 --> 00:28:29.090
so reliable that they
never needed the backups.

00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:44.090
The space age Ushered in many of the
technologies that have become ubiquitous of

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.066
the most notable was
satellite television.

00:28:47.075 --> 00:28:51.062
In 1962, Lincoln Laboratories transmitted
television via satellite.

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:55.002
For the first time using NASA's
Echo one balloon satellites,

00:28:55.012 --> 00:28:58.026
the picture transmitted 2,700
miles across the country.

00:28:58.048 --> 00:29:00.098
Was short and simple, just three letters.

00:29:06.008 --> 00:29:11.026
The space race was cool, but it's the
social change at MIT that I find truly

00:29:11.026 --> 00:29:16.054
remarkable. In 1964, we got McCormick
McCall, the first and only campus dorm built

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:21.010
for women. The population of female
undergrads grew to over 150 because

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:22.002
You know, they're older people.

00:29:22.002 --> 00:29:24.094
You know, you get yeah, your freshman
year and you can have the attitude of

00:29:24.094 --> 00:29:26.018
enjoying what you're learning.

00:29:26.042 --> 00:29:27.050
Somewhat <laugh>, right?

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.034
Especially since it just, it
makes such a better atmosphere.

00:29:31.057 --> 00:29:35.070
I came up here and visited last year
and I met lots of nice people and I went to

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.002
classes and things, and it seemed
like a really great place.

00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:42.018
Social life is nothing to snub and
the 20 to one ratio, you can't lose.

00:29:55.082 --> 00:29:58.079
I have not money.

00:30:00.075 --> 00:30:05.011
1964 is also when Shirley and Jackson
arrives on campus at the time.

00:30:05.011 --> 00:30:10.019
She's won of fewer than 20 black students
at MIT in 1968 when she and fellow

00:30:10.019 --> 00:30:13.075
student Jennifer Rudd graduate, they're
the first black women to earn their

00:30:13.075 --> 00:30:15.043
undergraduate degrees in mit.

00:30:15.048 --> 00:30:21.003
Jackson goes on to become the first black
woman to earn a doctorate in mit and the

00:30:21.003 --> 00:30:23.099
second black woman in the United
States to earn a doctorate in physics.

00:30:24.091 --> 00:30:28.099
1968 is also the founding year of the
Black students union with Jackson leading it

00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:29.075
in its first year.

00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:34.071
The MIT Black Student Union
was formed last spring to,

00:30:35.012 --> 00:30:39.059
to bring together black students to see
what they had in their minds and to see

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:44.043
what we could do. We presented our proposals
this fall to the administration, uh,

00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:47.067
about, uh, getting more
black students at mit.

00:30:47.067 --> 00:30:51.003
Hopefully, we'll have a hundred
freshmen in the fall,

00:30:51.051 --> 00:30:55.095
although this may be kind
of a naive, uh, estimate.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.039
It might be an overestimation,
but we are trying,

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:03.007
and now we're in the process
of recruiting black students

00:31:10.047 --> 00:31:11.063
After McCormick call.

00:31:11.063 --> 00:31:13.063
There are a number of
other changes to campus.

00:31:13.093 --> 00:31:16.091
The green building is completed in 1964.

00:31:17.026 --> 00:31:20.055
E 53 and E 55 followed
shortly thereafter.

00:31:20.073 --> 00:31:23.055
And in 1965, the student center opened.

00:31:23.085 --> 00:31:27.043
You can imagine how much construction
must have been going on at that time.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.079
Many of MIT's characteristic institutions
were born in this era.

00:31:38.001 --> 00:31:43.031
The interface edge program began in 1969,
the same year that Margaret mc launched

00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:45.015
the undergraduate research
opportunities program.

00:31:51.012 --> 00:32:01.039
In 1968, MIT and Wellesley began
the cross registration program pass.

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:04.023
Fail grading was also implemented
for students first two semesters.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.059
Uh, the school here is

00:32:11.006 --> 00:32:14.083
Sort of a machine where you go in and
they pound math and science into your head

00:32:15.035 --> 00:32:17.099
about six or seven hours a day.

00:32:19.009 --> 00:32:24.063
And when you get out of here,
you can do any engineering problem.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:31.055
Of course, there don't seem to be
very concerned with how much emotion or

00:32:31.055 --> 00:32:34.003
creativity or individuality
that you have left.

00:32:34.072 --> 00:32:39.036
They're not, There's no set
pattern of destroying this.

00:32:39.048 --> 00:32:48.088
It just seems that in learning so much
that is cold and unemotional so quickly,

00:32:49.082 --> 00:32:54.028
you don't have time to develop the emotional
responses that are usually associated

00:32:54.028 --> 00:32:56.059
with, let's say, a more
liberal education.

00:32:56.094 --> 00:33:00.007
People. People plan their
time very carefully.

00:33:00.007 --> 00:33:01.099
They, they budget their
time for their classes.

00:33:01.099 --> 00:33:04.023
They budget their time
even for their dates.

00:33:04.023 --> 00:33:06.083
You know, it's, it's, it's as if their,

00:33:06.083 --> 00:33:12.035
their whole social life were compartmentalized
into this five or six hours on

00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:14.075
Saturday night, because that's
the time they have to spend on it.

00:33:56.087 --> 00:33:58.063
Could you lower those signs, please?

00:34:01.022 --> 00:34:03.095
I have some very sad news for all of you.

00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:09.070
And that is that Martin Luther King was
shot and was killed tonight in Memphis.

00:34:11.076 --> 00:34:16.059
In April, 1968, the MIT community mourned
the passing of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther

00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:18.063
King Jr. Classes were canceled.

00:34:18.063 --> 00:34:21.018
Commemorative art exhibits were
put on display around campus,

00:34:21.037 --> 00:34:23.051
and students took time
to reflect on their place.

00:34:23.051 --> 00:34:24.043
In a changing nation.

00:34:24.053 --> 00:34:27.043
The everyone's birthday would soon
become a designated institute holiday.

00:34:27.066 --> 00:34:31.099
Years before it was made, a federal holiday
celebrated annually with the March a

00:34:31.099 --> 00:34:34.011
guest speaker and other
memorial activities.

00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:46.007
Therefore, and beyond this, I think the
students of today are the sensitive edge of

00:34:46.007 --> 00:34:52.027
society that is pressing against the
dehumanizing elements of technocracy.

00:34:53.003 --> 00:34:59.087
Human personality and values have
been in a losing war with the impersonal

00:34:59.087 --> 00:35:03.063
operation of a rapidly
evolving complex society.

00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:08.074
We are a nation incomparable
in wealth and power,

00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:13.011
but impoverished spiritually
and psychologically.

00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:20.074
Our activities generate, uh, bewildering
array of material goods and no

00:35:20.093 --> 00:35:21.078
satisfactions.

00:35:22.085 --> 00:35:28.007
Our machines have grown so large
and we have become so small.

00:35:29.052 --> 00:35:32.023
We no longer asked for
what purpose they are made.

00:35:32.093 --> 00:35:39.043
I must confess that, uh, that dream that
I had that day has a minute points turned

00:35:39.043 --> 00:35:40.055
into a nightmare.

00:35:41.013 --> 00:35:43.035
Now, I'm not one to lose hope.

00:35:43.045 --> 00:35:47.059
I keep on hoping, uh, I still
have faith in the future,

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.099
but I've had to analyze many
things over the last few years.

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:56.087
And I would say over the last few months,
I've gone through a lot of soul such in

00:35:56.087 --> 00:36:01.078
agonizing moments, and I've come
to see that, uh, we have, uh,

00:36:01.078 --> 00:36:03.063
many more difficult days ahead.

00:36:04.024 --> 00:36:08.047
And some of the old optimism
was a little superficial,

00:36:08.047 --> 00:36:11.066
and now it must be tempered
with a solid realism.

00:36:11.066 --> 00:36:16.099
And I think the realistic fact is that
we still have a long, long way to go,

00:36:17.073 --> 00:36:23.059
and that we are involved
in a war on Asian soil, uh,

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:28.031
which if not checked and stunt and
paused in the very soul of our nation.

00:36:30.097 --> 00:36:34.083
The sixties are marked by
this grave introspection.

00:36:35.056 --> 00:36:37.018
We were still high from World War ii.

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:38.078
We had defeated evil.

00:36:38.078 --> 00:36:42.043
We had conquered the world, frankly,
with nothing but the power of our minds and

00:36:42.043 --> 00:36:43.099
hands and a shitload of money.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:49.056
But in the sixties, it was puzzling
as America's engineers to wake up to the

00:36:49.056 --> 00:36:51.003
consequences of our deeds.

00:36:52.033 --> 00:36:56.099
Tonight, report from Vietnam
by Walter Crown Kite.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:03.028
How could the Vietnamese communists have
mounted this offensive with such complete

00:37:03.068 --> 00:37:06.008
surprise? Well, let's take a look

00:37:08.049 --> 00:37:09.084
On the other side of the globe.

00:37:09.093 --> 00:37:12.056
The bloodshed Vietnam
showed no sign of ending.

00:37:13.013 --> 00:37:17.052
In January, 1968, the via con blew
back at US forces with the nude strength

00:37:17.052 --> 00:37:24.024
destroying any illusions of an imminent
American victory across the United States.

00:37:24.039 --> 00:37:26.020
Students hearts were set on fire.

00:37:35.053 --> 00:37:40.091
In the wake of the Ted Offensive, a special
visitor came to MIT at the behest of an

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.024
undergrad named Michael Albert.

00:37:42.064 --> 00:37:45.052
19 year old Army Desert, Michael O'Connor
took refuge in the student centers,

00:37:45.052 --> 00:37:46.064
Las de Puerto Rico,

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:51.020
Where the day show over

00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:56.016
Linguistics professor, no Chomsky, a
mentor of this burgeoning student movement

00:37:56.023 --> 00:37:59.036
warned Albert and others of the severe
consequence to hosting a desert.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.032
The military police were
in the pursuit of O'Connor,

00:38:02.066 --> 00:38:04.028
but the students wanted
to make a statement.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.064
Few dozen students camped
out on the with O'Connor,

00:38:07.076 --> 00:38:09.091
while the rest of campus
was mostly disinteresting,

00:38:14.005 --> 00:38:16.016
He
Don't want to beat. As each day went by,

00:38:16.016 --> 00:38:17.099
Michael Albert and company
spread awareness.

00:38:19.023 --> 00:38:21.095
Hundreds of students tripled
into las as the week progressed,

00:38:21.095 --> 00:38:26.068
putting rock concerts and press conferences,
all in support of the desert classes

00:38:26.068 --> 00:38:27.052
had to be canceled.

00:38:31.063 --> 00:38:35.080
They gathered at all hours of the day
to support O'Connor field reporters and fend

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.036
off disruptors,

00:38:37.023 --> 00:38:41.072
Give up, give mad of violent civilization

00:38:43.089 --> 00:38:44.024
In

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.091
Civilization, where I

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:50.028
Eight days in federal agents arrested
Michael O'Connor while everyone would still,

00:38:53.037 --> 00:38:53.537
The

00:38:57.068 --> 00:39:00.091
Classes resumed and students
hunger for additional action.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.070
Yeah, I got the constitution on the run.

00:39:06.048 --> 00:39:10.099
Michael Albert started his career at
MIT as a physics major arriving on campus

00:39:10.099 --> 00:39:12.083
before the countercultural
event took over.

00:39:13.082 --> 00:39:19.059
I came back to mit and I looked
around, and it was quite a contrast.

00:39:20.062 --> 00:39:23.070
I saw gray walls as far as you could see.

00:39:24.093 --> 00:39:30.024
I saw faculty who would come in
and, and write textbooks on the wall.

00:39:31.003 --> 00:39:35.037
I saw an utter lack, a complete
absence of emotion.

00:39:35.078 --> 00:39:37.081
And then I began to understand why.

00:39:38.024 --> 00:39:42.016
It's because this place means
to produce a certain product.

00:39:42.063 --> 00:39:49.097
And the product is a very, a very well
trained, a very capable, a very brilliant,

00:39:49.097 --> 00:39:56.049
in many cases, scientist or engineer
who will solve any problem, any problem,

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.085
so long as it's of some
interest and so long.

00:40:02.067 --> 00:40:05.048
Inflamed by the Vietnam War,
I would end a few others,

00:40:05.048 --> 00:40:09.008
dedicated their undergraduate careers
to browsing the notoriously apathetic student

00:40:09.008 --> 00:40:14.028
body. After helping the deserter, he joined
Students for Democratic Society or sds,

00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:17.016
a national student movement dedicated
to ending the war effort.

00:40:22.037 --> 00:40:24.063
The students were plenty
riled up at this point,

00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:28.099
but you also had movement on the
faculty side, like with Noam Chomsky,

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:34.027
who finally enough was originally hired
by MIT to do research for the Cold War.

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:43.055
Noam Chomsky started at MIT 15 years
before Michael Albert as he wrapped up his

00:40:43.055 --> 00:40:44.083
fellowship in linguistics at Harvard.

00:40:44.092 --> 00:40:48.079
He knew that a faculty position was
out of the question in Chomsky's words,

00:40:48.081 --> 00:40:50.095
you could cut the antisemitism
with a knife.

00:40:51.072 --> 00:40:55.047
So he ventured a few blocks south to
MIT's research laboratory of electronics.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.083
He heard that it's leader, Drew
Weisner was rather liberal.

00:41:00.072 --> 00:41:03.015
We a quickly offer Chomsky
research position.

00:41:03.029 --> 00:41:08.031
His managers assigned him to a DOD funded
project to automatically translate Soviet

00:41:08.071 --> 00:41:10.035
documents to English through
digital computing.

00:41:13.086 --> 00:41:17.035
What followed was a rapid sent through
the institute as he revolutionized

00:41:17.035 --> 00:41:20.019
theoretical linguistics and built
MIT's new linguistics department.

00:41:20.045 --> 00:41:21.083
How the brain,

00:41:22.056 --> 00:41:26.027
It became a known antiwar activist
shortly after the conflict in Vietnam was

00:41:26.027 --> 00:41:27.031
escalated by JFK

00:41:27.052 --> 00:41:29.003
On the faculty at mit.

00:41:29.021 --> 00:41:33.083
And I've been, uh, getting more and more
heavily involved in antiwar activities for

00:41:33.083 --> 00:41:36.071
the last few years.
Uh, beginning with, uh,

00:41:37.021 --> 00:41:39.079
the writing articles and
making speeches and, uh,

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:41.063
speaking to congressmen
and that sort of thing,

00:41:41.063 --> 00:41:45.059
and gradually getting involved
more and more directly in, uh,

00:41:45.059 --> 00:41:48.003
resistance activities of various sorts.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:52.043
Uh, usually Mr. Chomsky writes
nonpolitical books, for instance,

00:41:53.051 --> 00:42:00.067
syntactic structures in 1957,
Cartesian Linguistics in 1966.

00:42:00.076 --> 00:42:05.083
He is a highly esteemed, a student of
modern language and linguistics who teaches

00:42:05.083 --> 00:42:08.023
nowadays at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:15.075
You say the war is simply an obscenity,
a depraved act by and miserable men,

00:42:15.075 --> 00:42:20.043
Including all of us, including myself,
including every, That's the next sense.

00:42:20.043 --> 00:42:22.027
This is the sense of theological
observation, isn't it?

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.011
No, I don't

00:42:23.011 --> 00:42:25.007
Think so. Because if somebody points
out, if everybody's guilty of everything,

00:42:25.007 --> 00:42:26.007
then nobody's guilty of anything.

00:42:26.008 --> 00:42:28.059
No,
I, no, I don't, I don't believe that.

00:42:28.061 --> 00:42:31.091
See, I think that, I think the point
that I'm trying to make and I think ought to

00:42:31.091 --> 00:42:35.003
be made seems to me,
uh, a very, in a sense,

00:42:35.003 --> 00:42:40.079
terrifying aspect of our society is the
equanimity and the detachment with which

00:42:41.042 --> 00:42:43.039
sane, reasonable, sensible people.

00:42:43.051 --> 00:42:45.031
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>
can't observe that event.

00:42:45.038 --> 00:42:50.035
I think occasional Hitler or lame or other,
that crops up these people would not be

00:42:50.035 --> 00:42:54.019
able to operate. Were it not for
the, this apathy and equanimity.

00:42:54.019 --> 00:42:56.027
And therefore, I think
that it's in some sense,

00:42:56.027 --> 00:43:00.040
the sane and reasonable
tolerant people who should,

00:43:00.098 --> 00:43:03.064
who share a very serious burden of guilt.

00:43:03.064 --> 00:43:07.004
Why do they, why do these agricultural
interests authorize us to intervene in South

00:43:07.004 --> 00:43:07.063
Vietnam?

00:43:07.063 --> 00:43:10.076
They did. If you consider this, this
is because we didn't intervene on this is a

00:43:10.084 --> 00:43:12.056
critical dimension. No, I
say that in the Philippines.

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:13.052
It was a critical look.

00:43:13.052 --> 00:43:14.056
The world is a complex place.

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:17.008
I'm aware there are certain
interests that were involved.

00:43:17.026 --> 00:43:21.060
MIT is a complex, Well, there were certain
interests that were involved in, sorry.

00:43:28.085 --> 00:43:32.056
As America continued to wage war, Chomsky
spoke around the country and taught

00:43:32.056 --> 00:43:35.088
undergraduate courses on the US
Empire, many of which were attended by

00:43:35.088 --> 00:43:38.000
Michael Albert and other
future student articles.

00:43:38.061 --> 00:43:42.036
He acknowledged the irony of holding
such strong anti-war views as a professor at

00:43:42.042 --> 00:43:45.056
mit, but he understood the power
that its faculty and students had.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:51.064
The same can be said, I think, for the
club of academic intellectuals who under the

00:43:51.093 --> 00:43:57.044
liberal administrations of the 1960s
designed and implemented the Vietnam War.

00:43:57.044 --> 00:44:01.084
And the, uh, other similar,
those smaller actions.

00:44:02.083 --> 00:44:07.052
This particular community is a very relevant
one to consider at a place like mit

00:44:07.052 --> 00:44:10.068
because of course you're all free
to enter, enter this community.

00:44:10.068 --> 00:44:12.096
In fact, you're invited
and encouraged to enter it.

00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:19.052
Uh, the community of technical intelligencia and
weapons designers and counterinsurgency,

00:44:19.065 --> 00:44:25.092
experts and pragmatic planners of
an American empire is one that you have a

00:44:25.092 --> 00:44:28.056
great deal of inducement
to, uh, become associated

00:44:28.056 --> 00:44:33.012
With. Leonardo DaVinci, who visualized
man's flight 500 years ago,

00:44:33.012 --> 00:44:35.064
experienced the same fever when he wrote.

00:44:36.018 --> 00:44:40.040
But once you have tasted flight,
you will walk the earth with your eyes,

00:44:40.059 --> 00:44:45.084
turn skyward, for there you have
been and there you long to return.

00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:49.064
This is John Fitch, MIT Science Reporter.

00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:51.096
A semester passed

00:44:51.096 --> 00:44:53.092
since Connor's arrest, an anger fomented.

00:44:57.099 --> 00:45:01.036
I would follow a little pathway on
something like a TV screen in front of me.

00:45:01.063 --> 00:45:04.039
That, that, uh, would direct
me, right, left, or center.

00:45:04.039 --> 00:45:09.059
I could pull the commit switch on
my stick and the computer took over, uh,

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.063
computer, figured out the ballistics,
the air speed, the, the slant range,

00:45:12.063 --> 00:45:14.091
and dropped the bombs when we
got to the appropriate point.

00:45:14.091 --> 00:45:18.080
So it was very much of a,
a technical expertise thing.

00:45:22.024 --> 00:45:24.095
Never could see the people,
you know, you never could see.

00:45:26.015 --> 00:45:29.047
Occasionally you saw the houses when
you were bombing around a village or bombing

00:45:29.047 --> 00:45:33.039
in a village. Uh, you know,
you never heard the explosion.

00:45:33.039 --> 00:45:35.080
You never, uh, saw any
blood or any screams.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.059
It was very clean.

00:45:43.007 --> 00:45:46.051
Students distrust towards MIT
as an organ of the state only grew,

00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:49.051
especially as they uncover the
institute's wartime projects.

00:45:53.026 --> 00:45:57.039
They revealed the Dock Draper iLabs creation
of an attack helicopter stabilizer,

00:45:57.039 --> 00:46:00.047
which allowed for sustained machine
gunfire while hovering in place.

00:46:01.078 --> 00:46:06.088
When we broke onto the airport where those
helicopters were and photographed them,

00:46:07.011 --> 00:46:10.039
came back with the photographs, we were
able to prove what we said all along,

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.088
which was that the helicopters were gun
ships and that the stabilization process

00:46:14.093 --> 00:46:20.011
was to be able to shoot the peasants
and the fields in Vietnam more accurately.

00:46:21.013 --> 00:46:26.095
Uh, I predict that inertial principles
will be used in all the guidance systems of

00:46:26.095 --> 00:46:31.091
the future. Many improvements will occur,
but the inertial principles will be

00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:32.095
always with us.

00:46:33.089 --> 00:46:37.051
And I can't presume to predict
what the future is gonna hold,

00:46:37.057 --> 00:46:40.059
but I'm sure it's going to be
different from anything we imagine.

00:46:40.082 --> 00:46:45.067
I'm sure it's also going
to be much more extensive,

00:46:45.078 --> 00:46:50.055
and we're gonna do many more tricks than
anybody today imagines that we can do.

00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:54.091
And how we do this, I don't know, but
the human race is certainly gonna go out into

00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:56.039
the stars. I thank you very much

00:47:03.061 --> 00:47:06.028
For multiple independently
targetable reentry.

00:47:06.028 --> 00:47:07.091
Vehicle was also uncovered.

00:47:08.068 --> 00:47:12.080
It allowed a single ballistic missile
to deploy multiple nuclear war heads to many

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:17.003
different targets, a boon for any nation
hoping to land a devastating first strike.

00:47:27.092 --> 00:47:33.028
On March 4th, 1969, students and faculty
canceled all classes in research so that

00:47:33.028 --> 00:47:35.051
the institute could reflect
on its role in the war machine.

00:47:35.093 --> 00:47:38.028
The action was known as
scientists strike for peace.

00:47:38.064 --> 00:47:43.099
Chomsky read his famous, the responsibility
of intellectuals and the student

00:47:43.099 --> 00:47:45.011
radicals took charge.

00:47:45.065 --> 00:47:50.023
The Union of Concerned Scientists was
also formed in their founding document.

00:47:50.023 --> 00:47:55.055
They warned the Stone Age may return
on the gleaming wings of science and what

00:47:55.055 --> 00:47:59.059
might now shower in measurable material
blessings upon mankind may even bring about

00:47:59.059 --> 00:48:03.099
its total destruction be where
I say time may be short.

00:48:14.007 --> 00:48:17.091
Elections for the undergraduate association
or UA were held shortly after the

00:48:17.091 --> 00:48:20.059
action founded in 1893.

00:48:20.061 --> 00:48:23.043
The role of the UA has always been
what the President makes of it.

00:48:23.043 --> 00:48:27.091
Sometimes its presence was barely felt,
and other times Michael Albert was in

00:48:27.091 --> 00:48:33.084
charge. Albert ran for UA president on
a sweeping platform, first and foremost,

00:48:33.097 --> 00:48:35.091
an end to all war research at mit.

00:48:36.076 --> 00:48:39.055
Additionally, an acceptance of
the Black suit union's demands,

00:48:39.063 --> 00:48:43.003
namely a vast increase in black undergraduate
admission and scholarships.

00:48:43.068 --> 00:48:46.076
He also promised a committee to alleviate
the housing crisis in Cambridge,

00:48:46.076 --> 00:48:48.063
which he blamed on MIT and Harvard

00:48:50.044 --> 00:48:53.036
In army of students put up
posters, handed out flyers,

00:48:53.036 --> 00:48:54.091
and campaigned across the dorms.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:01.023
After eight runoffs, Albert won as a
right RightIn candidate and has election

00:49:01.023 --> 00:49:03.043
achieved the highest voter
turnout in UA history.

00:49:26.078 --> 00:49:28.072
End it right now.

00:49:34.024 --> 00:49:38.039
If after all of this time and all of
this sacrifice and all of this support,

00:49:38.059 --> 00:49:40.043
there is still no end in sight.

00:49:40.078 --> 00:49:45.011
Then I say the time has come for the
American people to turn to new leadership,

00:49:45.053 --> 00:49:48.015
not tied to the policies
and mistakes of the past.

00:49:50.078 --> 00:49:55.059
I pledge to you, we shall have an
honorable end to the war in Vietnam

00:49:56.098 --> 00:50:01.032
This time. Vote like your
whole world depended on it.

00:50:05.087 --> 00:50:11.029
The fall semester of 1969 radicalized
even more students Nixon and promised to end

00:50:11.029 --> 00:50:12.049
the conflict upon his election.

00:50:12.049 --> 00:50:14.025
But there was no end to the war in sight.

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:24.053
In October, over a hundred thousand
people gathered in the Boston Commons to

00:50:24.053 --> 00:50:25.065
protest the Vietnam War.

00:50:27.031 --> 00:50:29.053
1000 MIT students attended.

00:50:36.016 --> 00:50:36.516
What

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.088
Student's perception of
MIT was at an all time low?

00:50:58.006 --> 00:51:01.056
The undergraduate student newspaper,
The Old Mole set a grim tone.

00:51:04.002 --> 00:51:08.080
MIT isn't a center for scientific
and social research to serve humanity.

00:51:09.027 --> 00:51:11.032
It's a part of the US war machine.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.076
MIT's purpose is to provide
research, consulting services,

00:51:16.076 --> 00:51:20.056
and train personnel for the US government
and the major corporations,

00:51:22.004 --> 00:51:26.096
research services and personnel, which
enable them to maintain their control over

00:51:26.096 --> 00:51:28.024
the people of the world.

00:51:31.022 --> 00:51:36.048
The November action coalitions campaign
was directed against MIT as an institution

00:51:37.005 --> 00:51:38.100
against its central purpose.

00:51:50.062 --> 00:51:52.036
The peak of unrest came in November.

00:51:52.082 --> 00:51:57.004
The November actions were a weeklong
series of sit-ins, pickets and protests.

00:51:58.087 --> 00:52:02.084
Protesters no longer wanted to pause,
were related research, but to disrupt it,

00:52:02.084 --> 00:52:04.076
The brother, you got
all wrong about the war.

00:52:04.076 --> 00:52:08.064
Brother. The North Vietnamese tropes
didn't enter South Vietnam and didn't start

00:52:08.067 --> 00:52:10.024
Taking apart the war until

00:52:10.024 --> 00:52:11.012
They were bombed.

00:52:11.012 --> 00:52:13.064
Look, we're getting, telling
me something about Vietnam.

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:16.072
All the relevancies, North
Vietnam was bombed, right?

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.084
Right. Wasn't a lot of
countries were bombed.

00:52:19.084 --> 00:52:21.016
Of course, a lot countries were bombed.

00:52:21.016 --> 00:52:22.060
You think it's right? Think it's right.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:25.088
All, all those mothers and children
getting a bombed think it's right.

00:52:26.023 --> 00:52:28.032
What happened Way, What
happened in way that's

00:52:29.011 --> 00:52:30.072
Protecting?
That's the kind what

00:52:30.084 --> 00:52:32.004
Happened. Look at, look at facts all.

00:52:32.004 --> 00:52:35.052
But what happened when the National
Liberation Front, your heroes liberated.

00:52:35.064 --> 00:52:37.036
Liberated the city of way.

00:52:37.055 --> 00:52:38.060
Okay. Yeah.

00:52:38.063 --> 00:52:39.084
What? I don't need sign.

00:52:40.007 --> 00:52:41.016
I don't need a sign.

00:52:41.022 --> 00:52:44.020
You don't need it. What happened in
the city of way when they liberated it,

00:52:45.003 --> 00:52:48.052
they literally dug mass execution
grave and executed people, right?

00:52:49.066 --> 00:52:50.064
Yes. I know if I'm back.

00:52:50.064 --> 00:52:52.052
Cause I was there doing
a 10 offensive friend.

00:52:52.052 --> 00:52:52.552
Yes.

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:54.064
Everybody here reminds

00:52:56.051 --> 00:52:59.088
They staged a sit-in, in MIT's
Center for International Studies,

00:53:00.039 --> 00:53:03.073
a CIA funded department whose lead
researchers helped develop torture and

00:53:03.089 --> 00:53:05.025
assassination programs in Vietnam.

00:53:07.072 --> 00:53:08.021
Your

00:53:09.065 --> 00:53:10.045
Attention,

00:53:12.028 --> 00:53:22.057
I must that a restraining order issued
by the Superior Court and the of course of

00:53:22.077 --> 00:53:27.033
violence on the campus in any professionals,
buildings or facilities,

00:53:27.033 --> 00:53:32.097
or in any corridor, stairways and entrances
there too or elsewhere on the Silk

00:53:32.097 --> 00:53:39.033
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
premises in such manner as to disrupt or

00:53:39.033 --> 00:53:44.029
interfere with normal functions conducted
by the set Massachusetts Institute of

00:53:44.029 --> 00:53:52.005
Technology in such place, or to block
or hinder access to or egress from any of

00:53:52.005 --> 00:53:56.025
such properties by set Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, faculty,

00:53:57.011 --> 00:54:00.029
administrators, students, employees.

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.069
I think I have a responsibility
to see what happens.

00:54:07.028 --> 00:54:08.053
Please leave this area.

00:54:09.008 --> 00:54:10.089
Please leave this area now.

00:54:10.089 --> 00:54:14.097
Please better stay the the way

00:54:45.053 --> 00:54:49.077
Later. Over 300 students blocked off
the infinite corridor preventing students,

00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:51.097
professors, and members of
the administration from working

00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:01.041
Get the fuck out.

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:03.057
Obstructed from his office.

00:55:03.057 --> 00:55:06.093
Provost Jerome Wener confronted the
articles and argued with them for hours.

00:55:09.055 --> 00:55:11.093
MIT President Howard Johnson
was nowhere to be found

00:55:18.056 --> 00:55:22.037
when MIT president Howard Johnson
had an atypical background.

00:55:22.066 --> 00:55:26.037
He served in an administrative role in
World War II and assisted in the rebuilding

00:55:26.037 --> 00:55:31.005
of France. Johnson came home to study
economics at the University of Chicago where

00:55:31.005 --> 00:55:32.013
he later became a lecturer.

00:55:32.046 --> 00:55:36.037
He went on to become a professor at MIT's
Sloan School of Management and became its

00:55:36.037 --> 00:55:37.049
dean in 1959.

00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:41.033
After seven years as Dean, he was
appointed the 12th president of mit.

00:55:45.034 --> 00:55:47.057
He always smiled when
students called him Hoja.

00:55:54.024 --> 00:55:58.081
George Kakis was about to begin his sophomore
year at MIT when his mother sent a

00:55:58.081 --> 00:56:00.016
letter to President Howard Johnson.

00:56:02.063 --> 00:56:06.009
The terms of his parents' divorce left
him without the funds to continue attending

00:56:06.019 --> 00:56:10.037
mit. His father was a career soldier,
and George planned to follow in his

00:56:10.057 --> 00:56:17.085
footsteps. Knowing Johnson's military
background, George's mother begged for

00:56:17.085 --> 00:56:21.057
compassion. The letter worked.

00:56:21.096 --> 00:56:26.001
Hojo granted Georgia Presidential Scholarship
covering all of his expenses and the

00:56:26.001 --> 00:56:27.037
two quickly became personal friends.

00:56:28.039 --> 00:56:31.077
One day the president even offered George
right across campus in his personal

00:56:31.077 --> 00:56:32.025
limousine.

00:56:35.008 --> 00:56:39.037
Around the March 4th protests, President
Johnson set up the Pounds Commission to

00:56:39.049 --> 00:56:43.073
consider the future of MIT's controversial
war labs, Draper's Instrumentation Lab,

00:56:43.087 --> 00:56:45.029
and the Lincoln Laboratories.

00:56:47.086 --> 00:56:52.025
He asked George to be the only undergraduate
representative serving alongside Nobel

00:56:52.025 --> 00:56:57.073
Laureates Institute professors, and eventually
Noam Chomsky Hojo begged Chomsky to

00:56:57.073 --> 00:57:01.009
join the commission, knowing it could
give the radicals a sense that their voice

00:57:01.009 --> 00:57:04.073
was represented as part
of the Pounds commission.

00:57:04.073 --> 00:57:08.085
George toward the war labs visited the
Pentagon and met with multiple senators.

00:57:19.034 --> 00:57:22.025
As he became more informed,
he became outraged

00:57:41.045 --> 00:57:42.009
Murderer.

00:57:43.052 --> 00:57:46.017
George teamed up with Michael
Albert and the other articles,

00:57:46.017 --> 00:57:49.009
and he joined the Rosa Luxenberg
chapter of the sds.

00:57:51.028 --> 00:57:54.081
Around the time of the November actions,
George and the other radical articles

00:57:54.081 --> 00:57:58.057
stormed in MIT corporation meeting
signs in hand and chance echoing down the

00:57:58.073 --> 00:58:03.053
infinite corridor. At the helm of
the boardroom, sat Howard Johnson,

00:58:04.068 --> 00:58:05.089
a shouting match erupted.

00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:10.033
Former MIT presidents and esteemed alumni
sat in shocked and hojo slowly walked

00:58:10.033 --> 00:58:10.565
towards
The door.

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:18.013
He whispered into George's ear

00:58:18.066 --> 00:58:19.053
It two.

00:58:39.002 --> 00:58:40.072
MIT had lost its patients.

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:45.052
Immediately after the November actions,
a disciplinary committee was formed to

00:58:45.052 --> 00:58:47.040
judge the behavior of
the radical students.

00:58:47.053 --> 00:58:51.008
Provost Weisner promised Michael
Albert that he was safe,

00:58:51.074 --> 00:58:55.080
but President Johnson made it
clear that his days were numbered.

00:59:00.072 --> 00:59:04.025
A few days before Christmas, the committee
charged Michael Albert with active

00:59:04.057 --> 00:59:06.081
participation in a demonstration
in which violence was present.

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:11.085
The demonstration was a stage interruption
of a general electric recruiting event.

00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:32.041
Students for Democratic Society was
tearing itself apart and the national

00:59:32.041 --> 00:59:34.097
organization fractured into
increasingly violent variants.

00:59:35.014 --> 00:59:35.049
We

00:59:35.049 --> 00:59:39.081
Protested, but then we began to realize
that if we really thought those values were

00:59:39.081 --> 00:59:42.073
important, that they weren't
gonna come about in the society.

00:59:42.088 --> 00:59:44.033
Just by protesting

00:59:55.098 --> 00:59:57.093
Protest of Albert's band from campus.

00:59:58.019 --> 00:59:59.097
The remnants of MIT's sds.

01:00:02.007 --> 01:00:06.086
In a rage, George and three other members
took a battering ram and broke down the

01:00:06.086 --> 01:00:11.042
door to President Johnson's
office for a hundred students.

01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:15.070
Poured in leaving Provost Wener standing
outside of the occupied territory to plead

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:31.051
with the belligerent. MIT
came down with an iron fist.

01:00:31.088 --> 01:00:35.086
The administration pressed charges against
Kaia Feas and two others for disruption

01:00:35.086 --> 01:00:36.026
of classes.

01:00:38.005 --> 01:00:38.066
George

01:00:38.066 --> 01:00:41.094
Was sentenced to state prison
and he earned his degree from mit.

01:00:41.094 --> 01:00:46.014
While in solitary confinement, the wardens
frequently threatened to send him to

01:00:46.014 --> 01:00:50.003
Bridgewater, a neighboring mental institution
for the criminally insane known for

01:00:50.003 --> 01:00:51.042
its vi mistreatment of patients.

01:00:55.067 --> 01:00:56.003
As

01:00:56.003 --> 01:01:00.046
The protest waned and the radicals broke
off, compromised was eventually achieved.

01:01:02.014 --> 01:01:06.026
MIT never canceled any wartime research,
but access to the Lincoln Laboratories was

01:01:06.026 --> 01:01:07.074
restricted from the rest of the institute

01:01:11.064 --> 01:01:15.018
and Draper's instrumentation that
I was renamed and moved off campus

01:01:21.066 --> 01:01:30.026
Store sinking the she by.

01:01:33.013 --> 01:01:33.513
Look,

01:01:34.034 --> 01:01:39.090
I have an additional, one small additional
question or moral remark to you that is,

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:44.059
that you wish you were very courageous
attitude to towards the war in Vietnam.

01:01:44.084 --> 01:01:51.007
How can you survive in an institution
like mit, which is known here as one of the

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:55.082
great war contractors and intellectual,
uh, makers of this war?

01:01:56.019 --> 01:01:57.066
Uh, there are two aspects to that.

01:01:57.066 --> 01:02:01.074
One is the question how
I'm, how MIT tolerates me.

01:02:01.074 --> 01:02:06.070
And the other question is how I tolerate
mit well as to how MIT tolerates me.

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:10.042
Uh, here again, I think one
shouldn't be overly schematic.

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:15.059
It's true that MIT is a major
institution of war research,

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:21.051
but it's also true that it embodies
very important libertarian values,

01:02:22.007 --> 01:02:26.018
which are I think, quite deeply
embedded in American society.

01:02:26.018 --> 01:02:31.026
Fortunately for the world, they're
not deeply embedded enough to save the

01:02:31.026 --> 01:02:35.038
Vietnamese, but they're deeply enough
embedded to prevent far worse,

01:02:35.038 --> 01:02:36.047
worse disasters.

01:02:36.047 --> 01:02:38.026
And here I think one has
to be a bit qualified.

01:02:38.082 --> 01:02:42.055
That is there is imperial
terror and aggression.

01:02:42.055 --> 01:02:47.011
There is exploitation, there is
racism, lots of things like that.

01:02:47.011 --> 01:02:54.070
But there's also, uh, a real concern coexisting
with it for individual rights of a

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.098
sort, which for example, are
embodied in the Bill of Rights,

01:02:57.003 --> 01:03:00.030
which is by no means simply an
expression of class oppression.

01:03:01.003 --> 01:03:04.047
It is also an expression of
the necessity to defend the,

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:06.018
in the individual against state power.

01:03:07.044 --> 01:03:10.074
Now these things coexist, you
know, it's not that simple.

01:03:10.074 --> 01:03:13.089
It's not just all bad
or all good, and uh,

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:18.086
it's because it's the particular balance
in which they coexist that makes it, uh,

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:22.086
that makes an institute that produces
weapons of war be willing to tolerate.

01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:27.022
Uh, in fact, you know, in many ways,
even encouraged to be quite honest, uh,

01:03:27.022 --> 01:03:29.045
a person who's involved in civil
disobedience against the war,

01:03:31.045 --> 01:03:32.057
Inter collegially.

01:03:32.057 --> 01:03:38.038
We've got over 20 teams, I think cross
country, soccer, baseball, basketball,

01:03:39.005 --> 01:03:43.013
track squash, Oh, and a
whole bunch of other ones.

01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:48.001
Do a lot of students
participate in sports

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.024
intercollegiate and intermurals combined.

01:03:52.024 --> 01:03:55.040
There's over 3000 students that
participate in athletics and mit.

01:03:58.038 --> 01:04:02.001
So you think athletic is a
major part of the life at mit?

01:04:03.084 --> 01:04:07.078
Not really. Damn, I screwed that up.

01:04:09.016 --> 01:04:10.089
What does MIT mean to you?

01:04:12.003 --> 01:04:13.013
That's a good question.

01:04:14.048 --> 01:04:15.039
It mean to me. Yeah.

01:04:17.055 --> 01:04:18.067
Should, you should give people

01:04:18.067 --> 01:04:19.080
What? Half an hour for that one.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:23.076
Really, Institute has changed quite
a bit since I've been here for four years,

01:04:23.097 --> 01:04:27.095
but trying to change student government,
there's been a flurry of political

01:04:28.028 --> 01:04:31.063
activity now over, and I'd be interested
to see what goes on for the next four

01:04:31.063 --> 01:04:31.563
years.

01:04:32.032 --> 01:04:32.532
Uh,

01:04:34.055 --> 01:04:37.059
Well, originally I came here because
I thought I wanted to be an engineer.

01:04:38.017 --> 01:04:42.063
And, uh, I, I like has
made me wonder, you know,

01:04:42.063 --> 01:04:47.015
many times whether I made the right
choice and I'm still not quite sure

01:04:47.051 --> 01:04:49.099
It's, uh, everything I wanted and more

01:04:51.014 --> 01:04:51.063
It's

01:04:51.063 --> 01:04:58.048
Music and art and lots of science and
math, a lot of interesting people and, uh,

01:04:59.043 --> 01:05:00.063
sports and.

01:05:01.024 --> 01:05:02.037
It's a tremendous place.

01:05:02.037 --> 01:05:05.057
Better than I expected,
and I expected the best.

01:05:11.063 --> 01:05:17.041
I'm happy with the, uh, department, mainly
for the kind of access to the professors

01:05:17.041 --> 01:05:18.069
that you have there.

01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:26.061
Personal opinion, unsubstantiated by
flag is that it's the best place to learn

01:05:26.061 --> 01:06:51.025
things like a balloon, a balloon, uh,
pink balloon, beautiful pink balloon.

01:06:51.079 --> 01:06:55.013
The grooviest grooviest thing,
just watching it up there.

01:06:55.013 --> 01:06:56.061
Coming right down at you.

01:06:57.007 --> 01:07:05.013
Yes, there's, I hardly anything
around here is typical.

01:07:40.063 --> 01:07:45.016
Counterculture has become such an integral
aspect of the MIT ecosystem that on

01:07:45.016 --> 01:07:47.013
campus it can barely be considered
to counterculture.

01:07:47.099 --> 01:07:51.061
And anywhere there are impressionable
young minds exercising their freedom and

01:07:51.061 --> 01:07:53.001
rebuilding against centralized authority.

01:07:53.041 --> 01:08:02.013
There are also drugs, lots of drugs,
an astounding amount of drugs.

01:08:03.006 --> 01:08:07.037
By the 1970s, MIT had already earned
a national reputation for its connection to

01:08:07.037 --> 01:08:13.016
hallucinogens. According to the fbi,
somewhere between 10 and 90% of the LSD used

01:08:13.016 --> 01:08:15.061
in the northeast United
States was produced at mit,

01:08:15.087 --> 01:08:20.073
specifically in the iconic Bexley house,
a dormitory directly across the street

01:08:20.073 --> 01:08:21.081
from MIT's front door.

01:08:23.035 --> 01:08:27.016
The head of house at Bexley was Professor
Jerome let fit who served in the role

01:08:27.016 --> 01:08:30.073
alongside his wife Maggie, a
noted writer and TV fitness guru,

01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:33.013
famous for her show on Boston's wgbh.

01:08:33.023 --> 01:08:34.081
I'm
Still here to lose this flag.

01:08:35.099 --> 01:08:38.077
I'm here because I've got
a bad back and a young wife.

01:08:39.074 --> 01:08:41.024
I'm in here to lose my tummy.

01:08:41.078 --> 01:08:43.077
The title, Short time,
I'm here to lose my belly.

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.061
I'd like to wear a size 12.

01:08:47.052 --> 01:08:50.053
Most people think you look for
your lifeline and your hands,

01:08:50.053 --> 01:08:51.069
but that's not where you look.

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:52.061
You look here

01:09:03.086 --> 01:09:08.045
As Besley's Head of House Professor Lettvin
was well known for his views on lsd.

01:09:09.098 --> 01:09:14.073
On May 3rd, 1967, Professor Lettvin
debated disgrace psychologist and former

01:09:14.073 --> 01:09:19.086
Harvard professor Timothy Leary,
the original representative for mit,

01:09:19.086 --> 01:09:21.059
backed out of the debate
at the last minute.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.099
So Lettvin in the middle of
a fog dissection in building 20,

01:09:25.002 --> 01:09:27.027
jumped into the debate
with zero preparation.

01:09:35.093 --> 01:09:38.094
One evening this spring, as part
of a student run lecture series,

01:09:39.005 --> 01:09:43.039
two men died for the souls of students
who packed MIT's Kresge Auditorium.

01:09:43.057 --> 01:09:47.023
They were Dr. Timothy Leary, founder
of the League for Spiritual Discovery,

01:09:47.023 --> 01:09:52.070
which advocates LSD as a religious sacrament
and MIT professor, Jerome Lettvin,

01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:54.099
who thinks of Dr. Leary
as an agent of the devil.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:00.015
Timothy Leary began experiments with
LSD as a lecturer in psychology of Harvard.

01:10:00.036 --> 01:10:02.078
Harvard dismissed him in 1963.

01:10:03.027 --> 01:10:06.078
He is now out on a $30,000 bond
for possession of marijuana.

01:10:07.013 --> 01:10:08.070
You're not just a college student.

01:10:09.088 --> 01:10:13.054
You are not just 22
or 23 or 24 years old.

01:10:13.054 --> 01:10:15.082
You're 2 billion years old.

01:10:17.008 --> 01:10:18.014
Had you forgotten that?

01:10:19.061 --> 01:10:23.050
Matter of fact, what can you remind
you, um, where you came from?

01:10:24.066 --> 01:10:28.086
Remember, you spent nine months in
a watery medium, the first nine months,

01:10:29.021 --> 01:10:31.010
this trip on this planet.

01:10:32.002 --> 01:10:32.502
Remember all that swashing?

01:10:36.056 --> 01:10:38.038
Now, could we have the
lights out now, please?

01:10:41.056 --> 01:10:43.002
Now, fire is dangerous.

01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:47.050
Fire can kill, fire, can burn destroy.

01:10:47.087 --> 01:10:50.018
As a matter of fact, the
first fell invented fire.

01:10:50.018 --> 01:10:51.070
Prometheus got in a lot of trouble.

01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:53.002
The FDA got in Washington.

01:10:53.042 --> 01:10:57.036
Remember, uh, they said, Wait a minute.

01:10:57.036 --> 01:11:00.044
They're going too fast. Maybe
we're not ready for a fire.

01:11:01.005 --> 01:11:04.020
As a matter of fact, that's a question
that often occurs to many of us these days.

01:11:04.032 --> 01:11:10.004
Maybe man isn't ready for powerful chemicals
like L s D and the many new ones that

01:11:10.004 --> 01:11:16.088
are coming. Maybe man's little mind isn't
ready at this moment in evolution to deal

01:11:16.088 --> 01:11:20.056
with too much, too fast
in the way of reality.

01:11:22.035 --> 01:11:24.092
Fire is, uh, danger.

01:11:25.028 --> 01:11:26.068
Maybe we should pass a law against it.

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:29.004
What are we gonna do about it?

01:11:29.086 --> 01:11:32.052
How we gonna keep people from burning
themselves up and hurting themselves and

01:11:32.052 --> 01:11:33.044
killing themselves with fire?

01:11:33.047 --> 01:11:39.008
Well, we gotta start training our kids
from the time they can listen to us.

01:11:39.036 --> 01:11:44.028
Don't you know that the real, real
goal of a scientist is to flip out?

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.076
Don't you know that?

01:11:46.022 --> 01:11:50.040
Had you forgotten or you thought that
the role of a scientist was to build bigger

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:54.008
and bigger stage sets for the
television show we got going here?

01:11:54.051 --> 01:12:00.020
Yeah. Uh, we had a big road running from
the Copson Roberts game here to the Cowboy

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.024
Indian Show over there.

01:12:01.086 --> 01:12:05.076
And your engineers are supposed to build
them so that we can go faster and faster,

01:12:05.098 --> 01:12:08.092
and father and father from television
show to television show.

01:12:09.026 --> 01:12:10.024
But, um,

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:17.013
If you take science seriously, and if
you take the history of science seriously,

01:12:17.013 --> 01:12:23.081
you'll realize that every great scientist
wasn't in it for the TV show commercial

01:12:23.081 --> 01:12:27.049
payoff. Now, the message
I have is an old one.

01:12:27.049 --> 01:12:31.073
It's the simplest and most classic message
that even passed on in world history.

01:12:31.076 --> 01:12:38.093
It's, uh, those six words drop out,
turn on, then come back and tune it in.

01:12:39.011 --> 01:12:41.005
Now, I'm sorry. I mean,
I didn't invent this.

01:12:41.007 --> 01:12:42.089
I'm just reading the lines
that were given to me.

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:44.073
You've got to drop out.

01:12:46.007 --> 01:12:49.009
Now. Um, there's a lot
said about, uh, education.

01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:51.013
Well, you've got to
finish your education.

01:12:52.008 --> 01:12:59.001
When I hear that said, uh, I, uh, shutter
and my cells shrink because I'm sorry to

01:12:59.001 --> 01:13:02.074
say this, and I say this with great love
and great affection because I'm part of

01:13:02.074 --> 01:13:04.058
this whole institution the way I'm going.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:09.094
But the education system at the present
time of the United States does neurological

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:15.054
damage to the nervous system and
functions as a narcotic addictive drug.

01:13:19.052 --> 01:13:23.050
You the younger generation in
particular, have got to drop out.

01:13:23.056 --> 01:13:25.038
And by dropout, I mean all the way.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.034
You can't vote.

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:27.054
I urge you not to politic.

01:13:27.062 --> 01:13:28.054
Don't pick it.

01:13:28.054 --> 01:13:36.018
Don't get involved in any of these menopausal
mind gains because it doesn't make

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:37.030
any difference.

01:13:38.018 --> 01:13:41.058
Remember, 1962, we voted for
a peace candidate <laugh>,

01:13:42.008 --> 01:13:43.054
and you think it makes a difference.

01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:47.094
I think it's time to stop, drop out.

01:13:50.012 --> 01:13:50.512
Thank you.

01:13:57.087 --> 01:14:02.028
When Dr. Timothy Leary, the high priest
of the league for spiritual discovery,

01:14:02.088 --> 01:14:05.076
finished speaking, Dr. Jerome
Lettvin took the floor.

01:14:06.049 --> 01:14:10.076
Dr. Lettvin was senior psychiatrist
at the Man State Hospital in Illinois.

01:14:11.021 --> 01:14:16.008
He is now professor of Communications
Physiology in the departments of biology and

01:14:16.036 --> 01:14:18.004
electrical engineering at mit.

01:14:18.053 --> 01:14:21.024
He also lectures in the
humanities department.

01:14:22.001 --> 01:14:27.016
Dr. Lettvin, who has three teenage children,
is known at MIT as a man students can

01:14:27.016 --> 01:14:27.516
talk to.

01:14:28.042 --> 01:14:38.034
Now, Tim, your argument is exceedingly
seductive and in the main,

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:44.098
I must admit that I find the press, uh,

01:14:44.098 --> 01:14:50.082
middle age and middle class enormously
powerful here in Cambridge.

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:53.014
Irritating is all hell.

01:14:55.004 --> 01:15:00.042
The horri part is that I too sit in
front of TV sets, feel myself slumping,

01:15:00.052 --> 01:15:01.074
pay the taxes.

01:15:03.076 --> 01:15:07.030
But the problem is whether
the naval really replaces tv.

01:15:09.009 --> 01:15:11.018
I mean, you sitting
in front of your naval,

01:15:15.028 --> 01:15:20.054
you sitting in front of your naval
strike, strike me as being, in a sense,

01:15:21.009 --> 01:15:23.022
very little better off in a first.

01:15:23.078 --> 01:15:27.010
Let's put it this way, no surprises
are likely to come about

01:15:27.066 --> 01:15:27.566
<laugh>,

01:15:30.028 --> 01:15:33.018
And you aren't even beguiled
by good commercials.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:42.006
Nevertheless, I think that we must
take your thesis extremely seriously,

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:49.026
and I will not do you the dishonor of
either attacking you on scientific rounds

01:15:49.026 --> 01:15:54.018
because the question as is very
obvious, is not scientific but moral.

01:15:55.038 --> 01:16:01.074
Therefore, for this reason, I would like
to confine my remarks strictly to the Es.

01:16:01.074 --> 01:16:03.018
Turn that damn thing off.

01:16:12.015 --> 01:16:17.036
I would like to confine my remarks strictly
to the Es technological questions

01:16:17.068 --> 01:16:22.068
involved. By that, I mean simply questions
of what constitute good and evil.

01:16:23.062 --> 01:16:28.016
But I feel somehow or another that
this man is in the hands of the devil.

01:16:29.027 --> 01:16:37.084
That is to say he is in a private hell
of a curious and somewhat Satan devising to

01:16:37.084 --> 01:16:45.008
look at this man sitting there with
the smile, this sup smile, ecstatic smile.

01:16:46.007 --> 01:16:47.004
I feel sick.

01:16:47.059 --> 01:16:49.044
I don't feel that I want to trade.

01:16:49.067 --> 01:16:51.044
I feel sick for him.

01:16:52.046 --> 01:16:59.016
And I ask of you, how many
would trade he assures you.

01:16:59.025 --> 01:17:03.044
He is in the utmost ecstasy
when you can get to him.

01:17:03.092 --> 01:17:06.020
Otherwise, he's in that ecstasy.

01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:09.064
Why would not any of you trade?

01:17:11.054 --> 01:17:15.016
Let us take another trade that
has been offered in the past.

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:19.096
You and I lived through
the period of lobotomies.

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:23.028
You walk into the office,
I don't like my mama.

01:17:23.031 --> 01:17:27.032
They lift your up, you know,
slash slash and you go out.

01:17:27.032 --> 01:17:28.016
It doesn't matter.

01:17:29.006 --> 01:17:34.044
You see, you have traded for,
it doesn't matter, a hunk of brain.

01:17:34.044 --> 01:17:37.096
After all brain tissue, as he tells
you, you're losing so much of it.

01:17:37.096 --> 01:17:38.084
What's a little bit more?

01:17:41.063 --> 01:17:42.024
Really?

01:17:44.005 --> 01:17:46.024
No, Here you trade it.

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:53.044
How many of you would take a lobotomy
given the guarantee that thereafter you don't

01:17:53.063 --> 01:17:57.076
care? You come in saying,
I don't want to care.

01:17:57.076 --> 01:17:59.092
Everything is bothering
the hell out of me.

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:03.012
Everything is bothering
the hell out of me.

01:18:03.051 --> 01:18:05.012
I wanna stop caring.

01:18:05.063 --> 01:18:06.072
I wanna be happy.

01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:10.040
And so he takes, you know, bang, bang.

01:18:12.033 --> 01:18:13.092
Is this a trade you would make?

01:18:14.074 --> 01:18:17.040
You are selling off the no functions.

01:18:17.095 --> 01:18:24.064
You're selling off exactly those functions
which have set you aside critically in

01:18:25.004 --> 01:18:26.064
every possible way.

01:18:26.071 --> 01:18:27.080
You're abrogating.

01:18:28.027 --> 01:18:33.036
You're dissolving these henceforth
suspended judgment for a while.

01:18:34.023 --> 01:18:41.008
I know a set of physicists who took a
while ago in group because they're curious

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:43.040
people. All physicists
are curious people.

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:46.020
That is, I mean, they're
not curious to look at.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:46.520
They are.

01:18:52.058 --> 01:18:56.003
They took in a group of
about five or six of them,

01:18:56.046 --> 01:19:01.058
They took some silo Sabin on the recipe,
gotten from the telephone number here in

01:19:01.058 --> 01:19:04.074
Cambridge that you're supposed
to call to get that recipe <laugh>.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.038
And having taken it, they got
violently sick the first day,

01:19:11.024 --> 01:19:14.022
and every one of them for
three months thereafter,

01:19:14.076 --> 01:19:20.002
was incapable of doing any theoretical
work on all behavioral counts.

01:19:20.002 --> 01:19:27.006
The same but clearly apparent
in their higher critical functions.

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:33.034
And you pay for the vision of
yourself by the loss of judgment.

01:19:33.084 --> 01:19:38.002
You pay for getting out
by the loss of judgment.

01:19:38.056 --> 01:19:44.050
You pay for whatever visions you get
by this loss in judgment and the loss in

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:47.046
judgment that stays and stays.

01:19:48.044 --> 01:19:50.066
Now you might say, How do I know this?

01:19:50.066 --> 01:19:51.086
Have I ever taken it?

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.050
Huh? No.

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:57.030
And I haven't taken it
for a rather simple reason.

01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:04.024
Seems to be a little bit
big, a little steep to pay.

01:20:05.038 --> 01:20:09.072
I'm giving the devil my judgment,
my soul, my intellect.

01:20:09.072 --> 01:20:13.076
All of the things I've
worked for, for this kick.

01:20:14.039 --> 01:20:15.088
Like an infomania.

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:18.076
Not like an erotic person,
but like an infomania.

01:20:19.099 --> 01:20:22.068
Does anybody here envy the infomania?

01:20:23.072 --> 01:20:26.088
After all, there she is
having orgasm after orgasm.

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:30.020
Wonderful. All day long without a star.

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:33.076
Beautiful, terrific.

01:20:34.086 --> 01:20:36.068
And anybody envy her?

01:20:37.075 --> 01:20:39.040
Does anybody envy?

01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:45.040
Why? Because you didn't envy that guy
who was sitting in the state hospital either.

01:20:46.018 --> 01:20:53.024
The kick is cheap, the ecstasy is cheap,
and you are settling for a second rate,

01:20:53.024 --> 01:20:57.056
permanent second rate world by the
complete aggregation of the intellect.

01:20:57.089 --> 01:21:02.016
In the old days, if it wasn't done by
lobotomy, it was done by psychoanalysis.

01:21:02.042 --> 01:21:03.072
Now it's done by drugs.

01:21:05.011 --> 01:21:06.084
I can find in myself.

01:21:08.013 --> 01:21:10.008
No joy in such an outlook.

01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:23.052
I'm David Brinkley.

01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:29.064
NBC News, Kent State University in Ohio
has had campus violence for three nights

01:21:29.065 --> 01:21:32.000
causing the National
Guard to be called in.

01:21:32.018 --> 01:21:36.052
And today the Guardsman opened fire
on the students killing four of them,

01:21:36.054 --> 01:21:38.060
two young men and two young women.

01:21:38.088 --> 01:21:41.048
Three were shot in the
chest and one in the head.

01:21:41.078 --> 01:21:45.044
The students were protesting
the American invasion of Cambodia,

01:22:30.062 --> 01:22:50.020
The to see goodbye.

01:22:50.083 --> 01:22:55.028
Four months after the incursion on President
Johnson's home countercultural icon,

01:22:55.028 --> 01:22:58.072
the Grateful Dad visited campus for an
impromptu concert and celebration of the

01:22:58.084 --> 01:23:03.036
November. The rock band performed on the
steps of the student center in front of a

01:23:03.036 --> 01:23:06.092
massive crowd. But heavy rains cut
the event short after only a half hour.

01:23:07.055 --> 01:23:11.056
Undeterred, the band returned the next
day and performed in the DuPont Gymnasium.

01:23:12.026 --> 01:23:16.012
The Epic show lasted for hours with
the Grateful Dead performing 52 songs.

01:23:23.057 --> 01:23:23.557
My

01:23:42.037 --> 01:23:47.024
Ho Joe's resignation in 1971 marked the
shortest tenure of any president in MIT's

01:23:47.024 --> 01:23:52.016
history. Covo Jerome Wener was appointed
his successor despite being seven years

01:23:52.016 --> 01:23:52.516
old.

01:23:54.002 --> 01:23:56.068
And may your administration be memorable?

01:24:02.028 --> 01:24:07.033
Jerome Wiesner was an electrical engineer
who began his MIT career in 1942 at the

01:24:07.033 --> 01:24:10.053
radiation laboratory before moving with
many of his colleagues to Los Alamos.

01:24:11.037 --> 01:24:15.049
After World War ii, he returned to campus
as a professor of electrical engineering,

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:19.009
eventually becoming the director of
the Research Laboratory of electronics.

01:24:19.058 --> 01:24:23.061
He famously said that getting an education
from MIT is like taking a drink from a

01:24:23.061 --> 01:24:24.001
fire hose,

01:24:25.014 --> 01:24:26.001
Dr. Wesner.

01:24:26.001 --> 01:24:29.097
But what really worries me today is what's
gonna happen to us if machines can think

01:24:30.003 --> 01:24:35.029
and what interests me specifically is
can they, Well, that's very hard question,

01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:36.061
answer if you'd ask me that question.

01:24:36.061 --> 01:24:39.061
Just a few years ago, I'd have
said it was very farfetched today.

01:24:39.061 --> 01:24:41.069
I just have to admit,
I don't really know.

01:24:41.092 --> 01:24:45.053
I suspect if you come back in four or
five years, I'll say, sure, they really do.

01:24:46.032 --> 01:24:47.057
Well if you're confused.

01:24:47.057 --> 01:24:48.065
Doctor, how do you think I feel?

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:54.037
We also had an impressive KU in Washington
during Eisenhower's administration.

01:24:54.066 --> 01:24:57.045
He advocated heavily to close
the missile gap with the Soviets.

01:24:57.073 --> 01:24:59.059
But became a voice of
restraint with Kennedy.

01:25:00.032 --> 01:25:03.035
He argued against man space missions
because of their extreme danger.

01:25:03.065 --> 01:25:06.087
And he warned frequently
of nuclear holocaust.

01:25:08.044 --> 01:25:11.087
He returned to MIT to become Dean
of the School of Science, then provost,

01:25:12.026 --> 01:25:13.019
then president.

01:25:15.015 --> 01:25:16.027
Exciting and challenging.

01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:18.071
But doesn't it worry?

01:25:19.050 --> 01:25:23.091
Well, sure it worries me, but you know,
the problems posed by the computer are

01:25:23.091 --> 01:25:27.027
really no different than the problems
we have with other products of technology.

01:25:27.074 --> 01:25:31.051
It's gonna take a great deal of wisdom
on our part to manage them, but if we do,

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.079
we are going to make a much better world.

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:36.007
Thank you, Dr. We

01:25:36.078 --> 01:25:40.007
Reason, as presidency created
a more well-rounded education,

01:25:42.084 --> 01:25:46.079
he established the Council for the Arts
at MIT and created the Ness Student Art

01:25:46.079 --> 01:25:56.007
Gallery. He also expanded the scope
of sha, the School of Humanities,

01:25:56.007 --> 01:26:21.071
Arts and Social Sciences to west part,
Notable for his enthusiasm for student life

01:26:21.097 --> 01:26:24.059
and was often seen around campus
engaging with the student body.

01:26:24.093 --> 01:26:28.003
You don't have to actually go out
and ask every student, you know,

01:26:28.003 --> 01:26:29.031
what's your opinion on this issue?

01:26:29.041 --> 01:26:32.027
Lot of 'em aren't gonna have opinions
on any random issue that you pick,

01:26:32.027 --> 01:26:35.047
but you've gotta at least say, We are
about to make a decision on this kind of

01:26:35.047 --> 01:26:38.023
thing. Anybody who's interested,
you know, please submit comments.

01:26:38.037 --> 01:26:42.035
Now, three years ago, this institute
went to a big decision of should we have a

01:26:42.035 --> 01:26:45.003
medical school? I didn't know about it.

01:26:45.003 --> 01:26:48.019
I've been here five years
and all the time I was here,

01:26:48.019 --> 01:26:51.051
nobody even suggested that we were
going through that kind of a discussion.

01:26:52.013 --> 01:26:54.015
Why not? Why weren't

01:26:54.015 --> 01:26:54.099
Students? Do you wanna know?

01:26:54.099 --> 01:27:01.015
Why not? Yeah. If we had to answer in
four days and because we had, you know,

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:06.003
it was obvious that we couldn't afford
to, Did it make a lot of sense to have a big

01:27:06.043 --> 01:27:07.067
exercise and frustration?

01:27:07.078 --> 01:27:10.063
Should we or shouldn't we have a medical
school that we didn't have the a hundred

01:27:10.063 --> 01:27:12.011
million that was gonna take the bill?

01:27:12.049 --> 01:27:16.051
The only way we could say yes is if
we could find somebody who would match the

01:27:16.051 --> 01:27:20.003
government money with a
promise of 50 million cash.

01:27:21.041 --> 01:27:26.019
And Dr. Killian and I said,
Let's try and then we can,

01:27:26.057 --> 01:27:30.027
and we hit five people
that we knew, or x people,

01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:31.095
I don't know how many
we finally talked to,

01:27:31.095 --> 01:27:36.091
but someone we couldn't even reach who
we thought were interested enough in medical

01:27:36.091 --> 01:27:41.019
schools, mit, and a whole thing to
see whether anyone was willing, you know,

01:27:41.019 --> 01:27:41.519
to say Sure.

01:27:42.055 --> 01:27:42.555
<laugh>.

01:27:43.081 --> 01:27:45.091
And, and nobody did.

01:27:46.090 --> 01:27:50.051
This was five days after Howard
became president of this institution.

01:27:51.029 --> 01:27:56.023
Six months before we had been totaling
up the bill on what we thought it was.

01:27:56.024 --> 01:28:00.039
We were gonna have to raise to do the
things we thought already had to be done to

01:28:00.039 --> 01:28:03.043
keep the promises that had been made,
like dormitories and new buildings.

01:28:03.043 --> 01:28:06.047
And so, and that came to 200
million that we didn't have.

01:28:07.005 --> 01:28:13.015
You know, And I don't see why that kind
of a decision has to be put to a popular

01:28:13.015 --> 01:28:14.079
referendum. And in fact, I don't think

01:28:14.079 --> 01:28:16.035
It has to be put to popular referendum.

01:28:16.035 --> 01:28:18.067
I think you just have to say
that, that you're making it.

01:28:18.067 --> 01:28:22.039
So that made, who

01:28:22.039 --> 01:28:25.059
Knows, One of the students might have
known somebody with 50 million in his

01:28:25.059 --> 01:28:26.011
Pocket.

01:28:28.050 --> 01:28:29.027
That's all.

01:28:51.031 --> 01:28:52.051
Hello? Yes sir.

01:28:52.051 --> 01:28:55.071
This cap, cap on that thing
on I'm gonna do is, you know,

01:28:55.071 --> 01:28:57.087
we're gonna do it now two
months from now, but yes.

01:28:58.056 --> 01:29:02.063
Uh, I hope you, uh, realize
how strongly I feel about that.

01:29:02.063 --> 01:29:04.055
Oh, I do. Yes. And I
hope you agree with it.

01:29:04.055 --> 01:29:09.003
Now, the point that I wanna make, however,
is that I think your figure for MIT has

01:29:09.003 --> 01:29:10.031
gotta be low. Let me explain.

01:29:10.031 --> 01:29:16.003
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we're putting over
500 million a year into that damned, uh,

01:29:16.099 --> 01:29:18.027
National Science Foundation.

01:29:18.045 --> 01:29:21.063
Yes. You know, isn't that true for
the whole, for the whole foundation?

01:29:21.063 --> 01:29:23.023
I think that's just right.

01:29:23.023 --> 01:29:26.075
But that's all, all of that
money goes to basic research.

01:29:26.075 --> 01:29:30.039
In other words, none of that's
for laser be, or, Right.

01:29:30.048 --> 01:29:34.039
No, that's right. The the, what I wanna
do is to take that and cut that to a

01:29:34.039 --> 01:29:37.059
hundred million. That's, but that
is not just one institution, sir.

01:29:37.059 --> 01:29:38.083
I know it is. I know it isn't.

01:29:38.083 --> 01:29:41.031
But I understand MIT gets
a hell of a chunk of that.

01:29:41.031 --> 01:29:45.071
They get as closely as we can
figure approximately 40 then,

01:29:45.071 --> 01:29:46.095
then why can't we cut that?

01:29:46.095 --> 01:29:49.035
Well, that's, that, that was,
that was the area we, Well,

01:29:49.035 --> 01:29:51.079
but he said there was only
31 million that could.

01:29:51.093 --> 01:29:57.044
Be cut. And uh, and, and my point is that
if they get 40 million from the National

01:29:57.044 --> 01:29:58.099
Science Foundation, we just cut it out.

01:29:58.099 --> 01:29:59.095
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm.

01:29:59.099 --> 01:30:02.091
<affirmative>. You see my point? Because
that's all subsidy of teacher salaries.

01:30:02.091 --> 01:30:06.080
Yeah. But you know, I'm thinking
of a 50, 60% cut, you know, for all.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.064
We've gotta have an austerity
budget next year.

01:30:08.064 --> 01:30:10.023
Yeah. And this is an opportunity mm-hmm.

01:30:10.027 --> 01:30:13.091
<affirmative> because higher education
is way, way over subsidized.

01:30:13.091 --> 01:30:14.084
They've gotten fat.

01:30:14.084 --> 01:30:18.035
Yeah. And, uh, frankly, uh, I just
think we ought to bust them hard.

01:30:18.035 --> 01:30:20.095
Well, we we're gonna have to
find plenty of areas to do it.

01:30:20.095 --> 01:30:22.064
And this is a, uh, perfectly good way.

01:30:22.064 --> 01:30:25.064
Well, education generally, you know,
is an area that you've gotta dig into.

01:30:25.064 --> 01:30:27.088
Yeah. But anyway, you
can see what I mean.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:29.060
You can't knock down the university.

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:31.076
You, California is uh mm-hmm.

01:30:31.099 --> 01:30:34.052
Lab for whatever the hell they're
doing and this and that.

01:30:34.057 --> 01:30:37.048
But what I mean is that when we're
in the piddly wing stuff mm-hmm.

01:30:37.052 --> 01:30:42.044
<affirmative> like, uh, oh, you know,
uh, I think some of this transportation and

01:30:42.044 --> 01:30:43.068
environment stuff is Yeah.

01:30:43.068 --> 01:30:48.015
Where it's, but you know, I want a
ruthless examination of it and we'll just

01:30:48.015 --> 01:30:49.007
tighten them all up.

01:30:49.007 --> 01:30:51.019
Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and
not renew the contracts.

01:30:51.019 --> 01:30:53.003
Yeah. Well it's right.

01:30:53.006 --> 01:30:56.056
And we'll just go right after these
people and knock their brains off.

01:30:56.065 --> 01:30:58.084
Now, I've been trying
to do this for years.

01:30:58.084 --> 01:30:59.007
You

01:30:59.007 --> 01:30:59.507
Know,

01:31:02.065 --> 01:31:05.076
The Nixon administration made significant
changes to the federal budget,

01:31:05.091 --> 01:31:09.031
including a 10% reduction
of NASA funding in 1971.

01:31:09.044 --> 01:31:13.095
After four successful moon
landings, a year later,

01:31:14.027 --> 01:31:16.060
humans would stand on the
moon for the last time.

01:31:21.069 --> 01:31:24.091
The final Apollo mission launched a
few months after the Watergate scandal,

01:31:25.011 --> 01:31:27.068
which marks at the beginning
of the end of the presidency.

01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:33.015
Former US President Henry
Truman died in 1972.

01:31:33.034 --> 01:31:38.011
And Linda B. Johnson followed in 1973,
meaning that at the time of Nixon's

01:31:38.011 --> 01:31:41.056
resignation a year later, there
remains no living US presidents,

01:31:49.093 --> 01:31:52.077
among the evidence used against
Nixon West's enemy's list,

01:31:52.089 --> 01:31:56.009
which named political opponents deemed
a threat to the Nixon administration.

01:31:58.002 --> 01:32:01.040
MIT had more names on this list
than any other single organization,

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.009
including Professor
Chomsky and President.

01:32:14.010 --> 01:32:15.048
I'm not satisfied with that.

01:32:22.048 --> 01:32:34.093
Subsidized they get

01:33:16.027 --> 01:33:21.066
By the late 1970s social tension still
pervaded Boston as attempts to alleviate

01:33:21.066 --> 01:33:22.082
disparities continued.

01:33:24.085 --> 01:33:26.014
It's cheering them a pat.

01:33:26.014 --> 01:33:27.023
I'm not for this.

01:33:27.023 --> 01:33:28.010
I don't care.

01:33:28.015 --> 01:33:31.066
My one will not go to school,
but it's chairman path.

01:33:31.081 --> 01:33:32.010
I

01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:35.006
Wouldn't care if they were green or purple
with the idea of putting my kid on a bus

01:33:35.006 --> 01:33:37.047
when I have a school right across
the street and where they should go.

01:33:37.049 --> 01:33:38.074
I don't care what color they are.

01:33:38.074 --> 01:33:40.031
All
They want is a seat in this school.

01:33:40.056 --> 01:33:41.055
Nothing else.

01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:52.066
Let us go to our neighborhood if I, you

01:33:55.052 --> 01:33:59.078
And why we was in school that was throwing
glass at black peoples and little kids.

01:34:00.002 --> 01:34:02.043
What's with
This again? Ride the clap.

01:34:03.061 --> 01:34:06.002
I think it's gonna be all
right if everybody comes.

01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:09.082
Stop being scared cuz Shoot, I don't
think there's nothing to be scared of.

01:34:11.023 --> 01:34:11.523
Um,

01:34:13.098 --> 01:34:20.039
We're, we're for you for believing
the dreams come true.

01:34:21.010 --> 01:34:22.002
We're for

01:34:22.077 --> 01:34:23.039
Paying

01:34:23.039 --> 01:34:26.090
The bills and working the bills for you.

01:34:27.035 --> 01:34:33.063
We're for hope, for learning
to cope, for kissing the,

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.090
The world outside of Cambridge
was rapidly changing.

01:35:02.013 --> 01:35:02.513
The

01:35:14.057 --> 01:35:18.098
Students faced increasing financial
challenges as MIT felt the pressures of a

01:35:18.098 --> 01:35:30.016
global recession and the economy at
large faced profound de-industrialization.

01:35:41.057 --> 01:35:42.085
It was the end of an era.

01:36:08.038 --> 01:36:08.538
Ooh.

01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:12.052
Things are going get easier.

01:36:13.098 --> 01:36:27.072
Ooh. Chow things get brighter
things, things buy.

01:36:31.078 --> 01:36:49.015
Yeah. Put and get when the world is much.

01:39:08.099 --> 01:39:15.066
Thank you. I moved to recall
the days of World War II when, uh,

01:39:15.066 --> 01:39:20.070
loosely n but intense community of science
and technology spanned the Atlantic

01:39:21.023 --> 01:39:24.086
between the British on the one hand,
and the Americans on the other side.

01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:30.063
Thousands of persons earnestly
engaged in waging that terrible war.

01:39:31.007 --> 01:39:36.002
Anxious for the best ideas and the
best criticism on how the weapons of war,

01:39:36.002 --> 01:39:40.027
the new weapons, the radar, the aircraft,
all those things which arose at that time

01:39:40.047 --> 01:39:43.039
could be used in the search
for the precious victory.

01:39:45.024 --> 01:39:50.031
Our power to shape is a
power for good and for evil.

01:39:50.031 --> 01:39:54.066
There is no more obvious comment
that I could make than that.

01:39:55.018 --> 01:39:58.031
What our power for shaping
means seems to me.

01:39:58.031 --> 01:39:59.078
It's double, It implies.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.024
Responsibility for those forms we make.

01:40:03.038 --> 01:40:08.096
And since we can shape the world and
can sometimes shape it well, it implies,

01:40:08.099 --> 01:40:14.084
I believe, most firmly hope as well for
the forms we can make in the landscape.

01:40:54.042 --> 01:40:58.099
When you're saying that, that you're
putting some sort of blame on me, that no.

01:40:59.093 --> 01:41:00.055
But then what

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:04.039
Off a spectacular fire,
two workers are dead.

01:41:04.039 --> 01:41:06.003
And here's ABC's Charles Murphy.

01:41:12.044 --> 01:41:16.091
In the 1980s, the United States government
imposed significant austerity measures,

01:41:16.098 --> 01:41:20.067
slashing the federal budget
across all non-essential sectors.

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:44.039
Across the country, research laboratories
and university students looked for news

01:41:44.039 --> 01:41:45.083
sources to fill the funding gap.

01:41:48.024 --> 01:41:51.027
Private corporations stood
ready to seize the opportunity.

01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:59.015
Private companies rapidly expanded
their financial ties to MIT,

01:41:59.038 --> 01:42:04.027
offering scholarships to students funding
for professorships and heavily investing

01:42:04.027 --> 01:42:05.095
in cooperative projects
with the institute.

01:42:12.006 --> 01:42:15.067
This new status quo was embodied
most iconically by the Media Lab

01:42:17.092 --> 01:42:23.059
founded 1985 by architect Nicholas Negroponte
and former MIT president Jerome

01:42:23.059 --> 01:42:28.011
Weisner. The Media Lab proposed a completely
new model for scientific research and

01:42:28.011 --> 01:42:28.511
funding.

01:42:29.081 --> 01:42:34.075
The media laboratory at Massachusetts
Institute of is a center for Advanced study

01:42:34.075 --> 01:42:38.067
and research. More specifically, the
Media Laboratory is a place where the

01:42:38.067 --> 01:42:43.031
invention of new means of communication
is tied to their innovative use.

01:42:44.084 --> 01:42:48.059
Instead of competing for public and
private dollars on a per project basis,

01:42:48.081 --> 01:42:53.003
the media lab allowed corporations and
government agencies to subscribe to general

01:42:53.039 --> 01:42:58.019
research themes. These subscribers
commonly referred to as member companies,

01:42:58.034 --> 01:43:02.000
received access to the media, lab's,
human capital, and intellectual property

01:43:03.008 --> 01:43:04.088
Designed by I Pay and Partners.

01:43:04.098 --> 01:43:09.004
The building was officially
dedicated October 2nd, 1985.

01:43:10.083 --> 01:43:14.036
It's equipped with the world's most
sophisticated computing equipment,

01:43:14.036 --> 01:43:20.020
including a supercomputer for
mainframes, 60 AI workstations,

01:43:20.054 --> 01:43:26.056
and over 300 personal computers for the
production and recognition of all forms of

01:43:26.056 --> 01:43:27.072
sound and pictures.

01:43:30.016 --> 01:43:33.060
Fundraising is an essential function
of any research lab and marketing is the

01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:34.048
engine of fundraising.

01:43:34.094 --> 01:43:39.056
But unlike most labs with successful
marketing means publishing papers and

01:43:39.056 --> 01:43:44.032
releasing data, the media lab affected
a more our inspiring technique about

01:43:44.032 --> 01:43:47.028
The protocols. Yeah, looks
like I'm free this afternoon.

01:43:47.028 --> 01:43:48.020
Let's see if he has time.

01:43:48.095 --> 01:43:51.008
When can I meet with
Walter This afternoon

01:43:51.059 --> 01:43:53.080
With room? Do you want
to meet this afternoon

01:43:54.031 --> 01:43:54.531
Walter

01:43:56.009 --> 01:43:57.016
Meeting with Walter.

01:43:57.016 --> 01:44:03.048
Scheduled today at one, getting
a call from Barry Hi,

01:44:04.005 --> 01:44:08.064
In which Media Lab demos captivated
audiences securing press coverage and

01:44:08.064 --> 01:44:14.020
attracting investors. Some of the work
at the Media Lab was farfetched and never

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:21.067
intended to have any real impact, but
a number of projects propel digital computing

01:44:21.067 --> 01:44:22.031
into the future.

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:34.037
A hundred years ago, I don't think anybody
would've said that machine intelligence

01:44:34.037 --> 01:44:38.033
was inevitable or even possible,
but something happened.

01:44:38.058 --> 01:44:43.073
Uh, around the turn of the century, it
was discovered that machines could do more

01:44:43.073 --> 01:44:44.089
than anyone had dreamed.

01:44:44.089 --> 01:44:47.057
It was implicit in the work
of some mathematicians.

01:44:48.027 --> 01:44:54.037
And then, uh, the great magician Girdle
discovered that it was possible for a

01:44:54.037 --> 01:44:58.065
machine to represent itself,
represent its own workings and.

01:44:59.053 --> 01:45:04.006
That was the first glimmering of the
idea that a machine could simulate another

01:45:04.006 --> 01:45:05.054
machine or simulate itself.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.014
The idea that a machine was an infinite
source of variations, uh, is a new idea.

01:45:13.002 --> 01:45:16.036
And, uh, so I think it
is a new step in evolution.

01:45:16.036 --> 01:45:20.020
There's never been anything
like it or an idea like that.

01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:24.068
You see, until that point people thought
that each machine did a certain thing,

01:45:24.068 --> 01:45:28.012
and that if you wanted something done,
you would have to build a machine to do

01:45:28.012 --> 01:45:29.048
that, and that's all it could do.

01:45:29.086 --> 01:45:33.008
But this discovery in the
1930s changed our view.

01:45:33.033 --> 01:45:36.008
It was discovered that if you
made the right kind of machine,

01:45:36.014 --> 01:45:40.012
and that's what a computer is,
it in a sense could do anything.

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:16.003
In 1983, MIT and IBM entered into a hundred
million partnership to create Project

01:46:16.006 --> 01:46:16.506
Athena.

01:46:18.008 --> 01:46:18.078
Project

01:46:18.078 --> 01:46:23.087
Athena is a pioneering experiment in
education at the Massachusetts Institute of

01:46:23.087 --> 01:46:29.087
Technology. Its overall goal is to find
out how the latest computer communications

01:46:29.087 --> 01:46:34.047
and graphics technologies can enhance
all phases of the learning process.

01:46:35.061 --> 01:46:41.091
The basic tool of Project Athena is a
campus-wide network of over 2,500 computer

01:46:41.091 --> 01:46:47.047
workstations now being installed, this
system will help students and teachers not

01:46:47.047 --> 01:46:52.043
only create innovative educational
software, but also to share programs,

01:46:52.064 --> 01:46:57.047
to exchange data, and to communicate
with greater ease than ever before.

01:46:58.029 --> 01:47:01.083
The project led to the development of
countless new computer system technologies.

01:47:02.034 --> 01:47:03.059
It's graphical interface.

01:47:03.091 --> 01:47:07.099
Protocol X is used in virtually every
personal computer, even to this day,

01:47:09.085 --> 01:47:13.043
and its open source license can be
found in millions of software projects.

01:47:18.091 --> 01:47:23.035
These algorithms and protocols became
critical components of a nationwide project.

01:47:23.082 --> 01:47:28.007
A network composed of previously isolated
military and university systems.

01:47:28.087 --> 01:47:38.039
Researchers were calling
the project internet Project.

01:47:38.042 --> 01:47:42.091
Athena changed the face of MIT's campus
and the working lives of MIT students.

01:47:43.028 --> 01:47:47.079
Whether they were in a dormitory or
in the student center or in a lab in the

01:47:47.079 --> 01:47:51.079
tunnels beneath the concrete, students
could sign into any Athena machine and

01:47:51.079 --> 01:47:52.087
access all their files.

01:47:52.087 --> 01:47:56.067
Instantly. They could email
professors, take classes,

01:47:56.082 --> 01:48:01.026
send direct messages to friends, and access
millions of books and journal articles.

01:48:13.051 --> 01:48:17.030
Of course, even with new technology
to help make academic life easier,

01:48:17.033 --> 01:48:19.054
students couldn't study all the time.

01:48:46.039 --> 01:48:49.066
Doesn't get much above the top
of the, the driver's building,

01:48:49.066 --> 01:48:51.086
but you get a good view of the
cord and all the activity here.

01:48:52.013 --> 01:48:53.082
This is aur.

01:49:29.085 --> 01:49:33.062
Students were finding it increasingly
difficult to prioritize anything other than

01:49:33.062 --> 01:49:43.054
school work. As a result, traditions
and student organizations were struggling.

01:49:45.024 --> 01:49:54.002
The undergraduate association, the
UA was disintegrated in February of 1983.

01:49:54.016 --> 01:49:58.070
The UA held its general assembly in annual
meeting that all members are expected to

01:49:58.070 --> 01:50:03.058
attend. The president forgot to show up.

01:50:03.092 --> 01:50:05.074
And so did over 100 others.

01:50:07.035 --> 01:50:10.002
In total, seven assembly
members attended the meeting.

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:57.060
Students were developing a more
serious approach to academic life,

01:50:57.082 --> 01:50:59.024
and they felt like they had to.

01:50:59.069 --> 01:51:01.004
Tuition was sky high.

01:51:01.024 --> 01:51:03.092
Their futures were full
of questions, not promises.

01:51:04.057 --> 01:51:08.068
In response, many students chased after
the high paying jobs of the new economy

01:51:11.071 --> 01:51:13.056
with a deregulated Wall Street.

01:51:14.006 --> 01:51:19.092
MIT students saw opportunity in high finance
as meritocracy surpassed nepotism jobs

01:51:19.092 --> 01:51:21.092
that Morgan Stanley were
no longer limited to.

01:51:21.092 --> 01:51:23.020
Legacy Harvard graduates.

01:51:24.022 --> 01:51:25.056
MIT students could compete.

01:51:36.046 --> 01:51:41.020
The war contractors and government agencies
that protestors denounced in the 1960s

01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:42.012
was still intact.

01:51:46.015 --> 01:51:50.068
What they now had to compete with these
high paying firms for MIT's most valuable

01:51:50.092 --> 01:51:51.012
resource,

01:52:06.063 --> 01:52:07.068
More technology.

01:52:30.084 --> 01:52:37.011
In January, 1978, NASA screened 8,000
applications to choose 35 individuals for

01:52:37.011 --> 01:52:38.007
astronaut. Group eight.

01:52:38.095 --> 01:52:42.071
Group eight was the first class of scientists
astronauts chosen in more than 10

01:52:42.071 --> 01:52:48.063
years. The proceeding class had been
formed in 1967 when Apollo missions were

01:52:48.063 --> 01:52:51.027
failing and the future of
NASA was in serious question.

01:52:53.002 --> 01:52:53.087
Throughout

01:52:53.087 --> 01:52:58.007
The 1970s, there were actually too
many trained astronauts waiting for the

01:52:58.007 --> 01:52:59.039
opportunity to fly in space.

01:53:01.008 --> 01:53:03.078
An opportunity that was
becoming increasingly there.

01:53:14.031 --> 01:53:18.038
In the 1980s, the dream of becoming
a space fairing people was reborn.

01:53:19.062 --> 01:53:20.086
Beautiful, beautiful.

01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.086
Route

01:53:21.086 --> 01:53:26.002
Eight was a trailblazing class of accomplished
scientists and pilots intended to

01:53:26.002 --> 01:53:28.058
launch NASA into a new
era of space exploration.

01:53:30.028 --> 01:53:33.022
The group included the
first six women astronauts,

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:37.030
the first three African American astronauts,
and the first Asian American

01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:42.078
astronaut. Four members of this class
would be chosen to through the space shuttle

01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:46.006
Challenger, including MIT
graduate Ronald McNair.

01:53:46.064 --> 01:53:47.078
Yep. Much more.

01:53:47.078 --> 01:53:49.058
Here he is, <laugh>.

01:53:50.027 --> 01:53:55.038
In 1984, he returned from a successful
flight aboard NASA space shuttle and became

01:53:55.038 --> 01:53:57.002
the second black man to fly in space.

01:53:58.021 --> 01:54:05.018
It's one of those indescribable things
and uh, a guy can have that pr I'm gonna get

01:54:05.018 --> 01:54:06.078
back in line to fly <laugh> <laugh>.

01:54:09.085 --> 01:54:10.074
Anyway, thanks.

01:54:10.074 --> 01:54:12.054
It's, it's great seeing all of you.

01:54:12.059 --> 01:54:17.066
So look around. It's just, uh, really
heartwarming experience and pleasure to see

01:54:18.005 --> 01:54:21.070
people who are genuinely appreciative.

01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:26.082
People who generally, genuinely express
a certain warmth in your faces.

01:54:26.082 --> 01:54:28.014
And it's just nice to see it.

01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:30.018
And, uh, I thank you for it.

01:54:30.018 --> 01:54:31.018
Thank you for coming out.

01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:36.030
Thank you. You take out insurance.

01:54:37.031 --> 01:54:39.094
As you move into those
jobs in the industry,

01:54:41.009 --> 01:54:45.030
you'll fire the world will
start to get quite frigid.

01:54:46.034 --> 01:54:51.054
Those of you that are headed for academia
as either on the elementary, secondary,

01:54:51.059 --> 01:54:57.034
or a college level as you move into
those areas in an attempt to rectify the

01:54:57.054 --> 01:54:59.098
negative trends in education
throughout our nation today,

01:55:00.056 --> 01:55:04.066
you find that the world
can get downright icy,

01:55:06.072 --> 01:55:10.026
but do not let the world's adversity
either stifle your enthusiasm,

01:55:11.044 --> 01:55:12.074
nor blind your vision.

01:55:13.048 --> 01:55:18.074
But the struggle towards excellence must
ever be conducted on the high plains of

01:55:18.074 --> 01:55:23.014
self confidence, a sense of
purpose and positive thought.

01:55:24.054 --> 01:55:28.035
Go forth with the knowledge
that you are better than enough,

01:55:29.032 --> 01:55:35.051
go forth with a desire to accomplish
with desire to contribute to our society.

01:55:36.015 --> 01:55:36.515
Great.

01:55:42.046 --> 01:55:44.063
Almost all this

01:55:50.003 --> 01:55:50.503
I was,

01:56:04.036 --> 01:56:08.097
This is shuttle launch control att
two minutes, 20, I mean two hours,

01:56:08.097 --> 01:56:10.013
28 minutes in county.

01:56:10.013 --> 01:56:14.033
Here comes the, uh, 51 hour flight
crew boarding the elevator, uh,

01:56:14.033 --> 01:56:15.085
for the second time in two days.

01:56:16.057 --> 01:56:26.057
Commander non McNair and uh, pilot Mike
Smith, followed by Crystal mcCal of teacher

01:56:26.057 --> 01:56:31.041
in space, Ellison Zuka and
payload specialist Greg Jarvis.

01:56:32.031 --> 01:56:33.057
Big smiles today,

01:56:35.081 --> 01:56:41.052
T minus 15 seconds minus Tim.

01:56:42.003 --> 01:56:45.032
9, 8, 7 6.

01:56:45.061 --> 01:56:46.096
We have main engine.

01:56:46.096 --> 01:56:57.028
Start 4, 3, 2, 1 and lift off, lift off
of the shuttle mission and it is cleared

01:56:57.028 --> 01:56:57.528
the tower.

01:57:06.031 --> 01:57:07.028
Good roll program.

01:57:07.028 --> 01:57:09.080
Confirmed challenger.

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:22.076
Now heading down range engines beginning
throttling down now at 94%.

01:57:23.023 --> 01:57:25.008
Normal throttles motion.

01:57:25.012 --> 01:57:32.004
Most of the plane 104% will
throttle down to 65% shortly.

01:57:35.065 --> 01:57:37.012
Engines at 65%.

01:57:37.012 --> 01:57:39.080
Three engines running normally
three good fuel ls.

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:48.056
Three good APUS velocity 8 2257 feet

01:57:48.056 --> 01:57:57.008

01:57:57.008 --> 01:58:07.068
hundred four challenger go and throttle
up thro one minute 15 seconds.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.068

01:58:11.068 --> 01:58:11.568
Seven

01:58:41.068 --> 01:58:42.076
Families of the astronauts.

01:58:43.071 --> 01:58:44.064
Very carefully.

01:58:46.088 --> 01:58:48.072
Obviously a major malfunction.

01:58:54.045 --> 01:58:55.056
We have no down link.

01:59:07.037 --> 01:59:10.092
Reports from the flight dynamics
officer indicate that the vehicle, uh,

01:59:12.012 --> 01:59:15.060
apparently exploded and that,
uh, impact, uh, in the water.

01:59:16.027 --> 01:59:17.084
Good evening. Here's what's happening.

01:59:17.090 --> 01:59:21.096
The report on the space shuttle disaster
is now in President Reagan's hands and the

01:59:21.096 --> 01:59:24.036
public will get a look
at it on Monday tonight.

01:59:24.036 --> 01:59:28.024
CNN John Hallman reports some hard
fought battles among members of the

01:59:28.024 --> 01:59:30.004
investigative commission
that wrote the report.

01:59:30.030 --> 01:59:34.084
One member was harshly critical of nasa
and therein lies the tale that John Hallman

01:59:34.084 --> 01:59:37.048
unfolds now from Washington Morning.

01:59:37.079 --> 01:59:42.020
It's a commission member Richard Fineman
charged that NASA had virtually ignored

01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:46.012
the principles of physics and good scientific
practice in designing, testing,

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:47.052
and building the space shuttle.

01:59:47.090 --> 01:59:51.096
The Nobel Prize winning physicist wrote
a section of the final report known as

01:59:51.096 --> 01:59:53.068
Chapter F Commission.

01:59:53.068 --> 01:59:56.068
Sources say, Chairman William Rogers
read the chapter and was furious.

01:59:57.017 --> 01:59:59.083
He called Fineman to Washington
Wednesday and urged.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.088
Honed down his criticism of NASA because
Chapter F threatened to destroy public

02:00:04.088 --> 02:00:06.068
confidence in the space agency.

02:00:09.095 --> 02:00:14.016
That was Richard Fineman, the Nobel
Prize winning physicist who startled the

02:00:14.016 --> 02:00:17.064
commission months signal when he dipped
an O ring into his glass of ice water to

02:00:17.064 --> 02:00:18.080
show that it wouldn't work when it

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:22.068
Was cold. Discovered that when you put
some pressure on it for a while and then

02:00:22.068 --> 02:00:26.008
undo it, it maintains,
it doesn't stretch back.

02:00:26.008 --> 02:00:27.060
It stays the same dimension.

02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:32.016
In other words, for a few seconds
at least, and more seconds than that,

02:00:32.017 --> 02:00:35.000
there's no resilience in
this particular material.

02:00:35.027 --> 02:00:42.040
When it's at a temperature of 32 degrees,
I believe that has some significance for

02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:42.540
our problem.

02:00:43.062 --> 02:00:46.080
How do you feel about the job
your commission did generally?

02:00:47.003 --> 02:00:48.056
I think we did a pretty good job.

02:00:48.056 --> 02:00:52.012
It turned out to be easier in some respects
than we could've imagined it was.

02:00:52.012 --> 02:00:53.032
I wanted to find out what happened.

02:00:53.039 --> 02:00:54.008
I, but

02:00:54.008 --> 02:00:58.016
I was curious, why did Chairman Rogers,
uh, say at the White House today that it

02:00:58.016 --> 02:01:00.092
would turned out to be more difficult
than he thought it was gonna be?

02:01:00.092 --> 02:01:01.084
What was he talking about?

02:01:02.035 --> 02:01:04.080
Well, maybe we had different
expectations.

02:01:06.003 --> 02:01:09.096
It's strange because at the very
beginning of this commission meetings,

02:01:09.096 --> 02:01:13.064
I remember Mr. Rogers saying, Well, of
course we may never find out what may the

02:01:13.084 --> 02:01:17.028
accident occur. And that turned
out that's what I meant was easy.

02:01:17.039 --> 02:01:18.092
I see.
You know, what happened and you,

02:01:18.092 --> 02:01:23.036
You know, what happened? What was difficult,
and I think maybe he's referring to

02:01:23.036 --> 02:01:29.032
this, was the discovery of these weaknesses
inside of NASA and their attitudes.

02:01:29.032 --> 02:01:33.024
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, this kind
of illogic about safety and so forth,

02:01:33.024 --> 02:01:37.052
which was so extensive from an organization
which had such a reputation in the

02:01:37.052 --> 02:01:41.096
country that it was hard for us to
find it out in a sort of emotional way,

02:01:42.037 --> 02:01:47.012
is to have to come around and say that
the wizard of ours, which everybody respect,

02:01:47.078 --> 02:01:49.016
has nothing behind it.

02:01:57.009 --> 02:01:57.076
Another

02:01:57.076 --> 02:02:00.044
Area where Boston flourishes
is academics.

02:02:01.006 --> 02:02:05.068
The greater Boston area has more students
per capita than any other region in

02:02:05.068 --> 02:02:10.064
America. Just across the Charles
River stand, two academic giants.

02:02:11.021 --> 02:02:21.048
Harvard University, not far away is
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

02:02:22.039 --> 02:02:28.012
Tech Students jokingly claim getting
an education at MIT is like trying to drink

02:02:28.012 --> 02:02:29.044
from a fire hose

02:02:30.027 --> 02:02:33.012
Like the rest of the northeastern
United States.

02:02:33.022 --> 02:02:36.036
The temperature in Boston
fluctuates wildly.

02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:40.072
The middle of summer is hot and
humid, and the winters can be harsh.

02:02:43.007 --> 02:02:44.075
Cambridge had a housing problem.

02:02:45.061 --> 02:02:46.003
MIT

02:02:46.018 --> 02:02:46.518
Said, Not

02:02:47.065 --> 02:02:49.055
Mit, we said, Noted

02:02:50.001 --> 02:02:54.039
Mit, despite the cold, a small crowd
of Cambridge activists gathered near Central

02:02:54.039 --> 02:02:58.091
Square this afternoon to protest planned
development of 27 acres of property owned

02:02:58.091 --> 02:03:02.056
by by mit working with Forest
City, a private developer.

02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:06.064
MIT wants to build a multimillion dollar
research and development complex here.

02:03:06.082 --> 02:03:11.048
The land known locally as the Simplex
site has been the center of controversy for

02:03:11.048 --> 02:03:16.032
more than a decade. Today, opponents distributed
documents they claim show that the

02:03:16.032 --> 02:03:18.056
developers deliberately
mislead the public.

02:03:18.085 --> 02:03:22.024
By underestimating the size
and scope of the planned project,

02:03:24.082 --> 02:03:28.060
MIT continued to expand and that meant
less real estate for low income housing.

02:03:29.059 --> 02:03:33.016
A group of protesters, including
both the homeless and homeowners,

02:03:33.035 --> 02:03:38.068
demanded that MIT construct at least 250
low income housing units as accommodation

02:03:38.076 --> 02:03:39.092
for this planned demolition

02:03:40.015 --> 02:03:44.012
Issues. And the needs are so great.

02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:52.088
The passion and the outrage about the
conditions under which we live causes us to

02:03:52.088 --> 02:03:59.028
go at each other and not to work
together to deal with the real enemy,

02:03:59.036 --> 02:04:02.076
which is the greed of mit.

02:04:03.055 --> 02:04:07.076
He's right, is right.

02:04:10.038 --> 02:04:14.080
The sunset and what started as
a protest turned into an occupation.

02:04:18.046 --> 02:04:23.048
100 homeless residents of Cambridge set
up an encampment at MIT's University Park.

02:04:24.003 --> 02:04:25.076
They called it Tent City.

02:04:36.073 --> 02:04:40.028
In time, the protest arrived
at the hood of MIT's campus.

02:04:45.003 --> 02:04:48.052
Students protested at the entrance
of MIT alongside the homeless.

02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:55.097
They demanded that the institute accommodate
the residents of Cambridge as it

02:04:55.097 --> 02:04:56.085
terraforms the city.

02:04:59.068 --> 02:05:04.085
What can happen in the future is directly
related to whether or not people in the

02:05:04.085 --> 02:05:10.057
neighborhoods, people across the city
get organized and say very clearly what they

02:05:10.095 --> 02:05:15.081
want in a process that they want
to control, the development process,

02:05:15.081 --> 02:05:19.020
that they wanna hold the
city, the b, the state,

02:05:19.035 --> 02:05:21.081
and the private developers accountable.

02:05:21.081 --> 02:05:23.089
People are not opposed to development.

02:05:24.003 --> 02:05:27.061
People wanna see things happen
that are in their interests.

02:05:45.072 --> 02:05:49.073
Eventually, MIT police stormed
the encampment and shut it down.

02:05:49.091 --> 02:05:54.028
Moving tents, clothing and personal
belongings on the sidewalk outside the lot

02:06:01.023 --> 02:06:03.013
For
15 minutes this afternoon.

02:06:03.013 --> 02:06:07.005
Millions linked hands to raise money
for America's hungry and homeless

02:06:07.005 --> 02:06:08.040
Hands across America.

02:06:08.073 --> 02:06:12.085
Formed one human chain spanning
16 states in the District of Columbia.

02:06:13.024 --> 02:06:17.013
Hens across Massachusetts, stretched
from Boston Common through the public garden

02:06:17.013 --> 02:06:20.016
on both the Boston and Cambridge
sides of the Charles River.

02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:25.005
Organizers say more than 6,000 took part
in the local effort to help the hungry and

02:06:25.024 --> 02:06:25.070
homeless.

02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:28.032
I'm Andy Hiller on the
Esplanade this afternoon.

02:06:28.032 --> 02:06:32.081
The scene before the people here
joined hens was festive and playful and

02:06:32.081 --> 02:06:37.073
party-like, but there was real work being
done and contributions collected and the

02:06:37.073 --> 02:06:40.069
work paid off. Do you ever
think about being homeless?

02:06:41.057 --> 02:06:46.093
No. Because when people are born, there's
always a place to go no matter what.

02:06:53.044 --> 02:06:54.073
It's a juicy steak.

02:06:55.057 --> 02:06:56.081
19. Shrimp and steak.

02:06:56.084 --> 02:06:58.028
Just 9 99.

02:06:58.036 --> 02:06:59.097
Hurry to Red Lobster.

02:07:09.024 --> 02:07:15.020
Just two hours ago, Allied Air Forces
began an attack on military targets in Iraq

02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:19.040
and Kuwait. These attacks
continue as I speak.

02:07:20.024 --> 02:07:24.093
Five months ago, sad ma saying,
started this cruel war against Kuwait.

02:07:25.041 --> 02:07:28.001
Tonight, the battle has been joined

02:07:28.019 --> 02:07:29.057
With no further due.

02:07:29.072 --> 02:07:30.032
Here's

02:07:30.032 --> 02:07:30.532
Known.

02:07:45.068 --> 02:07:52.013
I guess it's not considered good form
to start by, uh, admonishing your audience,

02:07:52.013 --> 02:07:54.036
but I don't think it's
a time for cheering.

02:07:55.061 --> 02:08:00.049
Uh, in fact, it's not easy to
talk about this topic at all.

02:08:01.026 --> 02:08:04.089
Uh, when we are just short of a decision,

02:08:05.028 --> 02:08:10.089
that's going to mean the slaughter of
tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people.

02:08:14.013 --> 02:08:16.016
These are on, We're on a sign on.

02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:19.089
Yeah. Here we got it.

02:08:19.089 --> 02:08:20.077
I think so. Okay.

02:08:20.077 --> 02:08:21.005
We'll,

02:08:21.074 --> 02:08:22.040
Funding

02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:25.013
Is made possible by the
National Science Foundation.

02:08:26.002 --> 02:08:30.005
US forces are expected to have an
enormous advantage in combat with Iraq.

02:08:30.019 --> 02:08:34.053
That's because new technology allows Americans
to do much of the fighting at night

02:08:34.064 --> 02:08:40.013
when they can see, and presumably the
Iraqis cannot seen here in tests in Arizona.

02:08:40.065 --> 02:08:45.001
Lantern uses a combination of infrared
and radar technology that turns night in

02:08:45.001 --> 02:08:47.013
today. The result is plain to see.

02:08:47.059 --> 02:08:51.005
And these are the young men
and women who make new things,

02:08:51.085 --> 02:08:54.049
discover and explore and
create new technology.

02:08:54.086 --> 02:08:58.044
The key to American economic
growth and national security.

02:08:58.072 --> 02:09:04.097
They build things here, things to use,
things that nearly think things that make

02:09:04.097 --> 02:09:05.069
life easier.

02:09:06.007 --> 02:09:07.057
Hey, where are we on this map?

02:09:07.057 --> 02:09:11.005
Huh? Huh? We are right dude.

02:09:11.016 --> 02:09:12.069
Right above Ku H City.

02:09:13.018 --> 02:09:15.020
We will take a highway down this highway.

02:09:15.022 --> 02:09:16.009
As a matter of fact,

02:09:25.024 --> 02:09:26.006
What was that?

02:09:26.044 --> 02:09:32.006
They build machines and systems than
manage those systems to build more machines

02:09:32.006 --> 02:09:33.014
and more systems.

02:09:34.093 --> 02:09:39.010
What do you think? Innocent.

02:09:39.052 --> 02:09:39.552
And

02:09:47.034 --> 02:09:47.090
These

02:09:47.090 --> 02:09:53.026
Are practical men and women devoted to
solving problems, some of their own making.

02:09:56.066 --> 02:09:58.032
And I think he alive.

02:09:59.049 --> 02:10:04.065
Bravo Battery has made it through
the war with zero thumbs up.

02:10:30.090 --> 02:10:35.057
In 1985, Yale University, a small
liberal arts college in New Haven,

02:10:35.091 --> 02:10:41.061
was looking to hire a new endowment
manager, David Swenson.

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:44.049
A 31 year old working on Wall
Street was given the job,

02:10:44.091 --> 02:10:48.050
the investment strategy he would employ
would change American universities forever.

02:10:49.066 --> 02:10:53.030
At the time, endowments were expected
to have modest, dependable growth.

02:10:53.091 --> 02:10:57.041
The purpose of endowments was to ensure
that universities could function even

02:10:57.041 --> 02:11:01.070
through difficult economic environments
to make universities immortal.

02:11:06.047 --> 02:11:07.082
Swenson took a new approach.

02:11:08.004 --> 02:11:10.066
The financial markets were performing
extraordinarily well,

02:11:10.066 --> 02:11:12.086
and Yale had an opportunity
to weep the profits.

02:11:13.066 --> 02:11:17.010
Massive tax free profits.

02:11:18.019 --> 02:11:22.002
Swenson exposed Yale's investment portfolio
to private equity and venture capital.

02:11:22.041 --> 02:11:25.038
Asset classes typically understood
as higher risk investments.

02:11:26.007 --> 02:11:29.090
Swenson also forged partnerships with
hedge funds and expanded Yale's investment

02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:33.082
arm. As the global economy surged,
so did Yale's endowment.

02:11:38.045 --> 02:11:40.078
Yale may have been the first
to benefit from the gold rush,

02:11:40.095 --> 02:11:42.066
but its rivals weren't far behind.

02:11:42.085 --> 02:11:46.098
Throughout the nineties, elite endowment
managers chased after increasingly ABBA

02:11:46.098 --> 02:11:48.014
investment opportunities.

02:11:48.049 --> 02:11:53.002
They invested in everything from speculative
internet startups to forest operations

02:11:53.002 --> 02:12:00.070
in Romania. The investors at the MIT
Investment Management Company caught on

02:12:00.070 --> 02:12:03.026
quickly. The time for
playing it safe was over.

02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:06.058
The endowment had to grow or
the institute would fall behind.

02:12:07.099 --> 02:12:12.010
In the face of this new reality,
MIT needed a new kind of president,

02:12:12.056 --> 02:12:15.018
one who could attract investors
and make lucrative deals.

02:12:20.070 --> 02:12:23.090
President Charles Best was well
suited to handle this transition.

02:12:24.043 --> 02:12:28.090
He earned a PhD in mechanical engineering
from the University of Michigan in 1967,

02:12:28.090 --> 02:12:32.054
where he remained for 20 years working
as a professor and eventually becoming

02:12:32.054 --> 02:12:36.030
provost. In 1990, Chuck was appointed.

02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:48.054
As MIT's 15th President MIT chose Vest,
an outsider for his technical background

02:12:48.054 --> 02:12:50.062
and strong track record in
university administration.

02:12:56.085 --> 02:13:00.036
He described his appointment to the
presidency as a call to national service.

02:13:02.054 --> 02:13:07.052
For decades, the American Research Universities
have served this nation exceedingly

02:13:07.052 --> 02:13:13.004
well. But today the American public
is calling into question the value of our

02:13:13.024 --> 02:13:18.048
research. Universities and no longer
tends to view science and technology as the

02:13:18.048 --> 02:13:19.080
foundation of progress.

02:13:20.002 --> 02:13:22.091
The public's attention is
caught not only by the debate,

02:13:22.091 --> 02:13:25.088
over the costs and quality
of undergraduate education,

02:13:26.022 --> 02:13:29.036
but by the debate over the
cost and conduct of research.

02:13:30.003 --> 02:13:34.032
Vest had assumed the position when the
public private research structure forged by

02:13:34.032 --> 02:13:37.040
President Compton and Vannevar
Bush was crumbling.

02:13:39.049 --> 02:13:43.064
He committed his presidency to reviving
successful collaborations between academia,

02:13:44.032 --> 02:13:45.032
industry, and government.

02:13:45.041 --> 02:13:49.032
Now these are the kinds of young
men and young women in whom we,

02:13:49.061 --> 02:13:55.036
through the federal government, must
invest if we are going to embrace excellence

02:13:55.036 --> 02:13:56.080
rather than mediocrity.

02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:01.088
President Vest would lead
the institute for 14 years,

02:14:02.004 --> 02:14:06.036
reshaping the appearance of the campus,
reforming student life and pioneering new

02:14:06.036 --> 02:14:10.088
initiatives. Nearly one fourth of MIT's
current square footage was built under the

02:14:10.088 --> 02:14:15.040
best administration, and he directed
MIT's evolution into a super institute.

02:14:16.050 --> 02:14:19.036
His office founded the Picker
Institute for Learning and Memory,

02:14:19.098 --> 02:14:24.068
the McGovern Institute for Brain Research,
the Broad Institute and the Institute

02:14:24.068 --> 02:14:25.084
for Soldier Nano Technologies.

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:30.020
President

02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:34.036
Vest also made headlines when his administration
released a study on the status of

02:14:34.036 --> 02:14:38.068
women faculty in science at mit, a report
that acknowledged discrepancies in the

02:14:38.068 --> 02:14:40.088
treatment of senior faculty
on the basis of gender.

02:14:41.082 --> 02:14:45.088
The report would spark a nationwide reckoning
over gender equality in academia.

02:14:46.045 --> 02:14:49.084
At mit, the percentage of women
faculty would increase steadily.

02:14:49.084 --> 02:15:04.080
For all the years following the report
in Geneva, Switzerland, Tim Burners.

02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:07.052
Leary was working as an independent
contractor at cern,

02:15:07.074 --> 02:15:09.084
the European Center for Nuclear Research.

02:15:22.065 --> 02:15:28.012
In 1989, he authored a white paper proposing
something he called the Worldwide Web,

02:15:28.055 --> 02:15:31.088
a collection of protocols and algorithms
built on top of the internet.

02:15:35.010 --> 02:15:40.100
His paper introduced websites, web service
links and error correcting mechanisms,

02:15:41.018 --> 02:15:44.072
the innovations that enable the Internet's
evolution into an earth shadowing

02:15:44.072 --> 02:15:50.028
system. The web's main innovation was
hypertext, a deceptively simple idea with a

02:15:50.028 --> 02:15:50.528
strong history.

02:15:52.075 --> 02:15:56.044
Back in 1945, there was
this guy, Niver Bush,

02:15:56.086 --> 02:16:00.088
and he was working for the US government
and one of the ideas that he put forth

02:16:00.088 --> 02:16:05.100
was, Wow, humans are creating so much
information and we can't keep track of all

02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:09.024
the books that we've read or the
connections between important ideas.

02:16:09.054 --> 02:16:11.060
And he had this idea called the Memex.

02:16:13.016 --> 02:16:16.040
At the end of World War ii,
American scientist and engineer,

02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:19.056
Vannevar Bush published
his concept for the memex,

02:16:20.059 --> 02:16:24.016
A device to augment human
memory and index information.

02:16:24.077 --> 02:16:28.036
He believed people could navigate
information quickly if the process of

02:16:28.036 --> 02:16:29.080
cross-referencing was automated.

02:16:30.026 --> 02:16:36.008
The most essential feature Bush Road was
the process of tying two items together at

02:16:36.008 --> 02:16:37.040
CER Labs in Switzerland.

02:16:37.050 --> 02:16:40.011
Tim Burner's, Leary finally
brought the pieces together.

02:16:40.018 --> 02:16:44.016
His worldwide web became the first
hyper text tool for the masses.

02:16:44.025 --> 02:16:47.024
Because of the way that hyperlinks
were first constructed,

02:16:47.024 --> 02:16:52.084
they were intended to be not only used
by many people, but created by many people.

02:16:53.036 --> 02:16:57.024
To me, it's one of the most
democratic designs ever created

02:17:02.049 --> 02:17:06.048
In 1994 with over 10 million
users now on the web,

02:17:06.069 --> 02:17:10.084
Tim Burn Leary came to MIT where he
founded the Worldwide Web consortium.

02:17:10.084 --> 02:17:20.064
Swishing, his group would standardize
the new suite of languages and protocols that

02:17:20.064 --> 02:17:27.003
the web necessitated through mit, the
web matured and made the internet accessible

02:17:27.003 --> 02:17:27.503
to the average person.

02:17:29.015 --> 02:17:32.056
With such a powerful invention,
a better world was inevitable.

02:17:34.053 --> 02:17:39.032
You don't think that some of the claims
being made for it are hugely exaggerated?

02:17:39.032 --> 02:17:39.092
I mean, when the

02:17:39.092 --> 02:17:42.027
Telephone was, no. You see,
I don't, I don't, I don't agree.

02:17:42.027 --> 02:17:46.008
I don't agree. I think the internet,
I don't think we've even seen the tip of the

02:17:46.008 --> 02:17:51.068
iceberg. I think the potential of what
the internet is going to do to society,

02:17:51.068 --> 02:17:55.056
both good and bad, is unimaginable.

02:17:56.018 --> 02:18:01.011
I think we're actually on the cusp
of something exhilarating and terrifying.

02:18:02.018 --> 02:18:03.052
It's just a tool though,

02:18:03.052 --> 02:18:04.072
Isn't it? No, it's not.

02:18:05.001 --> 02:18:06.084
No, it's an alien life form.

02:18:06.084 --> 02:18:10.016
What do you think, I mean,
when you think then about the

02:18:10.016 --> 02:18:11.027
It's their life on mine.

02:18:11.027 --> 02:18:12.088
Yes. It's just landed.

02:18:12.088 --> 02:18:13.008
Here

02:18:19.069 --> 02:18:20.011
Was

02:18:20.011 --> 02:18:25.016
A violent scene on the Esplanade tonight
when a free punk rock concert and really

02:18:25.016 --> 02:18:25.084
got out of

02:18:25.084 --> 02:18:30.076
Control. An estimated 50,000 people crammed
the Esplanade to hear the band Green

02:18:30.082 --> 02:18:31.084
Day performed.

02:18:31.098 --> 02:18:36.032
The band ran from the stage as a
crowd surge fourth during the show.

02:18:41.094 --> 02:18:45.068
I didn't think I would have fun here
and I was looking to have at least some fun.

02:18:45.068 --> 02:18:47.072
I mean, I wanted a good
education of course, other

02:18:47.072 --> 02:18:50.076
Than I guess being a student,
I'm, uh, also run track.

02:18:51.043 --> 02:18:55.027
I was involved with the human powered
Hydrofoil team since it was started about

02:18:55.027 --> 02:18:58.035
three years ago. I think it's really
easy to join things just in general.

02:18:58.064 --> 02:19:01.068
There was a party every night
if you, if you wanna do that.

02:19:05.022 --> 02:19:08.076
Fraternities have been integrated
life at MIT since the days before.

02:19:08.076 --> 02:19:09.095
It was known as mit.

02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:15.044
When Boston Tech was originally
founded in 1861.

02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:17.011
There were no dormitories.

02:19:17.097 --> 02:19:20.016
In fact, in the history of the institute,

02:19:20.016 --> 02:19:22.032
there have never been enough
dormitories to house.

02:19:22.032 --> 02:19:27.072
Every undergraduate fraternities
have always been there to close the,

02:19:28.075 --> 02:19:29.084
Everything is

02:19:29.084 --> 02:19:30.027
Over

02:19:31.042 --> 02:19:32.060
And I'm feeling

02:19:32.095 --> 02:19:34.019
Since its foundation.

02:19:34.019 --> 02:19:38.060
In the 1880s, Greek life has exploded
into a massive cultural force at mit.

02:19:39.055 --> 02:19:43.016
Fraternity membership encompassed one
fifth of the student body in 19 hundreds,

02:19:43.066 --> 02:19:48.011
one third of the student body in 1915
and to over half of all male students across

02:19:48.011 --> 02:19:49.048
more than 25 chapters.

02:19:49.048 --> 02:19:59.084
By the end of the 1990s with so many.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.028
Organizations at mit.

02:20:01.028 --> 02:20:02.080
Competition is inevitable.

02:20:04.067 --> 02:20:08.064
Over the years, fraternities have found
a variety of ways to challenge each other,

02:20:08.064 --> 02:20:11.080
including everything from intramural
sports to prank wars.

02:20:12.046 --> 02:20:18.048
But undoubtedly, the main competition
between fraternities is rush a period of

02:20:18.048 --> 02:20:20.092
about a week when chapters
recruit new members.

02:20:22.063 --> 02:20:27.000
Russia's fundamental to Greek life
anywhere, but as is often the case,

02:20:27.086 --> 02:20:29.076
MIT students put their own spin on it.

02:20:32.099 --> 02:20:34.048
Talk about a management experience.

02:20:34.048 --> 02:20:38.008
I, um, so I applied to be rush share.

02:20:38.010 --> 02:20:42.084
You gotta figure out how
to go find, you know,

02:20:43.012 --> 02:20:47.036
freshman on campus and like reel them
into your fraternity and find the best ones

02:20:47.036 --> 02:20:48.088
and convince 'em to join.

02:20:48.088 --> 02:20:51.084
And it's intense cuz you're like,
Oh my God, if I don't, you know,

02:20:51.094 --> 02:20:55.068
all these 25 other fraternities
are like competing for the same kids.

02:20:55.068 --> 02:20:59.008
And like, if I don't do a good
enough job, then, you know,

02:20:59.008 --> 02:21:02.044
we don't have a big enough pledge class
and our dues go up and then it's even

02:21:02.044 --> 02:21:05.020
harder next year. And like, it's like
this death spiral that it's all my fault,

02:21:05.022 --> 02:21:07.024
you know? And then you
start to break it down,

02:21:07.069 --> 02:21:12.032
there's a thousand kids who enter the
class, 600 of which are guys, and then,

02:21:12.062 --> 02:21:15.032
you know, a couple hundred
join, uh, fraternity.

02:21:15.050 --> 02:21:17.080
And so you sort of, okay,
that's a sales funnel.

02:21:18.030 --> 02:21:19.084
You figure that out
and you're like, okay.

02:21:19.084 --> 02:21:22.016
You start looking at all the
people you have and you're like,

02:21:22.016 --> 02:21:23.032
these people are really social.

02:21:23.032 --> 02:21:27.008
And so you can send 'em out in the van
to go hang out with kids on campus and get

02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:29.020
'em back. And then these people,
they're not that motivated,

02:21:29.020 --> 02:21:32.016
but if you give 'em snacks and drinks,
they'll like hang out and tell good stories.

02:21:32.051 --> 02:21:35.024
This is like talent management, you know?

02:21:35.024 --> 02:21:38.032
And so all these things come back in
a way that I was really not expecting.

02:21:38.077 --> 02:21:41.008
Um, and just the feeling of just
like having to figure it out.

02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:44.080
But getting that practice in a, in
kind of a safe place was really valuable.

02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:48.004
And, and the fraternity was for
me, uh, a great way to do that.

02:21:57.081 --> 02:22:02.012
In the 1990s, fraternities at MIT
were experiencing the golden era.

02:22:04.036 --> 02:22:08.048
Participation was high and the social
scene throughout MIT was the epicenter for

02:22:08.048 --> 02:22:09.096
college students across the Boston area.

02:22:13.089 --> 02:22:18.032
At the time, freshmen were not required
to live on campus and they often moved into

02:22:18.032 --> 02:22:23.016
fraternity houses. Shortly after pledging
this tradition created the fundamental

02:22:23.016 --> 02:22:24.064
divide between MIT men.

02:22:25.015 --> 02:22:31.016
They were dorm boys and they
were threat boys, dorm traditions,

02:22:33.050 --> 02:22:34.060
and Greek traditions.

02:22:36.050 --> 02:22:38.072
And the two social spheres
had little overlap.

02:22:40.087 --> 02:22:41.072
Regardless

02:22:41.072 --> 02:22:45.012
Of residential status, alcohol plays
a significant role in student life.

02:22:45.012 --> 02:22:52.008
In the nineties, many fraternities
had strong cultures of drinking,

02:22:52.014 --> 02:22:53.040
but so did dormitories.

02:22:54.004 --> 02:22:57.096
Baker House spent 17% of its
student life budget on alcohol,

02:22:58.010 --> 02:23:00.080
and all the dorms commonly
hosted unregulated

02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:01.004
Parties.

02:23:21.045 --> 02:23:25.072
At the peak of its intoxication,
MIT experienced a horrible accident.

02:23:27.013 --> 02:23:31.060
In the spring of 1997, a student fell
through this ceiling at Lambda Kay Alpha

02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:32.084
falling four stories.

02:23:33.073 --> 02:23:37.096
He survived the fall, but there was substantial
injury to both the student and to

02:23:38.004 --> 02:23:49.024
the sentiment towards Greek life, the
heavy drinking culture of the student body

02:23:49.024 --> 02:23:52.088
came under scrutiny, but for the
most part, life continued as normal

02:23:54.057 --> 02:23:55.024
Classes

02:23:55.024 --> 02:23:57.044
Were hard, parties were harder.

02:24:06.027 --> 02:24:10.028
Eventually, students dispersed for the
summer and took a much needed break from

02:24:39.025 --> 02:24:45.000
In the history of mit, there is perhaps
no event more tragic and consequential than

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:52.028
the death of Scott Kruger when Rush concluded
at the beginning of the 1998 academic

02:24:52.028 --> 02:24:57.084
year fire game of Delta, known on
campus as Fiji had recruited 12 pledges.

02:24:59.063 --> 02:25:02.049
The pledgers moved into their
new home shortly thereafter.

02:25:02.055 --> 02:25:07.045
And on Friday, September 26th, the pledgers
attended Fiji's Big Brother Ceremony.

02:25:08.002 --> 02:25:12.073
In the tradition of the ceremony, each
pledge received a dedicated big brother in

02:25:12.073 --> 02:25:15.017
upperclassmen who could guide
him through life in the fraternity,

02:25:15.017 --> 02:25:17.049
through MIT and beyond.

02:25:21.074 --> 02:25:25.061
In preparation for the ceremony, pledges
were instructed to drink beer and whiskey

02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:27.077
as they all watched
the film, Animal House

02:25:37.078 --> 02:25:38.089
La Italian bags

02:25:38.093 --> 02:25:43.017
Plans. After finishing the movie,
the pledges were introduced to their big

02:25:43.017 --> 02:25:45.053
brothers, and welcome to Step
Closer into the Brotherhood.

02:25:46.015 --> 02:25:55.017
Celebrations followed Scott's big, embraced
him and handed him a handle of Bacardi

02:25:55.017 --> 02:25:55.517
spice To him.

02:25:57.083 --> 02:25:58.081
Celebrations

02:25:58.081 --> 02:25:59.081
Went on for hours.

02:26:00.085 --> 02:26:05.001
Scott complained of nausea, so the brothers
laid him on a couch to rest and left

02:26:05.001 --> 02:26:20.005
him alone for 10 minutes, they returned
to find Scott covered in vomit.

02:26:21.018 --> 02:26:22.017
He wasn't breathing.

02:26:25.087 --> 02:26:28.085
The paramedics rushed him to the
Beth Israel Deacon, his hospital.

02:26:46.056 --> 02:26:48.006
The consequences were swift.

02:26:50.034 --> 02:26:54.002
MIT's Fiji chapter was immediately
suspended by the national organization.

02:26:55.008 --> 02:26:58.045
All dorms and living groups agreed
to cancel any alcoholic events.

02:26:58.072 --> 02:27:01.034
And President Vest promised total reform.

02:27:03.047 --> 02:27:07.083
President Vest pledged to rebalance the
arrangement between fraternities and mit.

02:27:09.005 --> 02:27:13.070
The relationship had always been one
of symbiosis of mutual benefit and respect.

02:27:14.086 --> 02:27:19.039
Students enjoyed more robust social lives,
and MIT had a solution to its housing

02:27:19.039 --> 02:27:23.007
problem. But the administration
had lost its patients.

02:27:24.067 --> 02:27:27.087
President Vest promised to build
more undergraduate dormitories,

02:27:27.095 --> 02:27:30.051
providing more options for
students to live on campus.

02:27:31.025 --> 02:27:34.099
Responsible graduate students were
also hired to live in and supervise every

02:27:34.099 --> 02:27:36.051
fraternity and independent living group.

02:27:36.051 --> 02:27:45.083
From that point forward three years
later, after extensive arbitration,

02:27:46.007 --> 02:27:49.035
president Charles Best personally
apologized to Scott's parents.

02:27:50.036 --> 02:27:53.063
In his eyes, he and MIT failed Scott.

02:27:54.082 --> 02:27:57.093
It was MIT's responsibility
to keep him safe.

02:28:05.001 --> 02:28:07.091
Universities across the country
saw the writing on the wall.

02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:11.087
A national reporter for ABC
News described the new paradigm

02:28:13.019 --> 02:28:17.043
After the student movement of the 1960s,
students asserted many of their adult

02:28:17.043 --> 02:28:19.083
rights by marching on campuses
and going to war.

02:28:20.042 --> 02:28:24.011
This translated into an attitude that
schools had no legal responsibilities.

02:28:27.009 --> 02:28:35.027
Now schools are assuming liability in
administrative remarked parents have much

02:28:35.027 --> 02:28:37.078
greater expectations of what
the college's role should be.

02:28:38.086 --> 02:28:40.035
What you see is a shift.

02:28:40.076 --> 02:28:43.047
Schools now function a
lot like businesses do.

02:28:44.022 --> 02:28:46.099
They sponsor activities
and the courts see that.

02:29:02.056 --> 02:29:04.039
Uh, today we've had a national tragedy.

02:29:06.003 --> 02:29:13.019
Uh, two airplanes have crashed into the
World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist

02:29:13.019 --> 02:29:14.011
attack on our country.

02:29:16.030 --> 02:29:20.023
I have spoken to the vice president,
to the Governor of New York,

02:29:21.008 --> 02:29:26.019
to the director of the fbi, and I've ordered
that the full resources of the federal

02:29:26.019 --> 02:29:31.083
government go to help the victims
and their families and the,

02:29:31.083 --> 02:29:39.099
and to conduct a full scale investigation
to hunt down and to find those folks who

02:29:40.007 --> 02:29:40.507
committed this act.

02:29:48.010 --> 02:29:52.015
Once news of the attack on the World
Trade Center reached the Student Body campus

02:29:52.017 --> 02:29:58.003
was quiet, students packed into the
Athena clusters, looking for information.

02:29:58.049 --> 02:30:03.011
But CNN's News website had crashed
from the massive volume of traffic in the

02:30:03.011 --> 02:30:07.051
uncertainty. The administration decided
to proceed with normal operations and

02:30:07.051 --> 02:30:09.091
students continued going to class
for the remainder of the day.

02:30:11.028 --> 02:30:15.023
On the evening of September 11th, President
Vest announced that the following day

02:30:15.023 --> 02:30:19.019
would be a half day with classes ending
early so that students could attend a vigil

02:30:19.019 --> 02:30:26.003
on Kresge lawn. Student responses to
the September 11th attacks were varied.

02:30:27.002 --> 02:30:30.055
Some students condemned the attacks
as senseless violence and of those who

02:30:30.055 --> 02:30:33.047
condemned some called for
peace and others for war.

02:30:36.015 --> 02:30:40.075
Other students will personal pieces
expressing their struggles with hope and

02:30:40.075 --> 02:30:42.055
purpose in the light
of their own mortality.

02:30:46.002 --> 02:30:50.059
Some criticized America's response
to the tragedy while others praised MIT's

02:30:50.059 --> 02:30:51.095
community vigil and blood drive.

02:30:54.086 --> 02:30:59.091
Others still were critical of the institute
complaining that MIT did not slow down

02:30:59.091 --> 02:31:02.007
enough for the community
to process what had happened.

02:31:04.035 --> 02:31:08.091
These editorial lists provided about
at least one thing in the world.

02:31:08.091 --> 02:31:12.026
After nine 11, the institute
did not slow down,

02:31:27.052 --> 02:31:30.094
And because it's all changed
now, I can get by with saying it,

02:31:30.094 --> 02:31:34.098
but the first time I visited
here and drove down Vassar Street,

02:31:35.004 --> 02:31:39.090
the backside of the campus,
I was actually appalled.

02:31:39.090 --> 02:31:47.022
I could not believe that this
was the famous mit we had, um, uh,

02:31:47.022 --> 02:31:51.058
still buildings that had been
built during World War ii, uh,

02:31:51.058 --> 02:31:55.042
that were made out of asbestos
shingles and chainlink fences,

02:31:55.042 --> 02:31:56.062
and just looked miserable.

02:31:57.078 --> 02:32:00.086
Front door of the campus
is of course, the wonderful,

02:32:00.086 --> 02:32:07.034
iconic view of killing court and the
great dome and the columns and so forth.

02:32:07.065 --> 02:32:09.002
Absolutely beautiful.

02:32:10.003 --> 02:32:13.090
So there was a little something
in me that said, you know,

02:32:13.090 --> 02:32:16.014
wouldn't it be nice to
change this a little bit?

02:32:16.014 --> 02:32:22.078
And then that began to be built upon
by the things that needed to change a bit in

02:32:22.078 --> 02:32:25.022
the student and and
community, uh, culture.

02:32:30.079 --> 02:32:34.066
At the dawn of the new millennium, Charles
Vest had already been president for 10

02:32:34.066 --> 02:32:39.086
years, molding the institute into the
modern mit The endowment was surging,

02:32:39.086 --> 02:32:43.022
which meant more buildings, more
institutes, and more prestige.

02:32:56.046 --> 02:32:59.047
President Vest remembered
the promises he had made.

02:33:01.028 --> 02:33:07.007
In 2002, construction of Simmons Hall
was completed creating space for 300 more

02:33:07.007 --> 02:33:08.011
undergraduate students.

02:33:10.041 --> 02:33:14.007
The birth of Simmons finally made
possible a Landmark Institute policy.

02:33:14.078 --> 02:33:19.019
From that point forward, all MIT freshmen
would be required to live on campus.

02:33:21.064 --> 02:33:25.043
As students moved into Simmons,
and Rush was severely regulated,

02:33:26.035 --> 02:33:31.055
President Vest was seizing his opportunity
to correct the excesses of student life

02:33:31.055 --> 02:33:32.019
at mit.

02:33:32.036 --> 02:33:36.091
So this set us up for some,
um, some real tensions and,

02:33:36.091 --> 02:33:44.031
and many of us felt that we were not
kind of engaging the students in a broader

02:33:44.067 --> 02:33:50.055
academic community as undergraduates,
that their loyalty was to small housing

02:33:50.055 --> 02:33:54.011
groups that might be an
independent living group,

02:33:54.011 --> 02:33:58.067
might be a floor in the dormitory, literally
might be a fraternity or a sorority.

02:33:59.057 --> 02:34:03.007
But because of the pressure, they
sought out these small groups.

02:34:03.017 --> 02:34:07.051
And historically they had gotten
very great support out of that,

02:34:08.013 --> 02:34:12.051
But still there was just some
underlying things and some, uh,

02:34:12.051 --> 02:34:17.007
sort of social trends that had started
back in the seventies that had never quite

02:34:17.019 --> 02:34:18.007
been given up.

02:34:18.076 --> 02:34:20.095
So there was a lot of
that that had to be done,

02:34:21.001 --> 02:34:25.043
and a bit of what I just called
sanding down around the edges.

02:34:25.043 --> 02:34:30.011
You know, you want this to be
an intense, rigorous education.

02:34:30.011 --> 02:34:34.039
That's what we do at mit, but you
don't want to become a parody itself.

02:34:34.092 --> 02:34:41.059
So we did feel that we had to do some
things to kind of brighten and lighten up the

02:34:41.059 --> 02:34:43.035
environment, uh, a little bit.

02:34:46.073 --> 02:34:47.015
See,

02:34:47.053 --> 02:34:49.043
MIT has a very unique housing system.

02:34:49.078 --> 02:34:54.015
Unlike other schools which randomly
assign you to a freshman dorm at mit,

02:34:54.015 --> 02:34:55.023
you have a choice in where you live.

02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:59.087
We have 11 dormitories and five cultural
houses, all with their own personality,

02:34:59.087 --> 02:35:01.015
traditions and quirks.

02:35:01.035 --> 02:35:04.051
Above all, we want you to live in
a place where you feel comfortable.

02:35:04.095 --> 02:35:06.059
Three, two,

02:35:38.029 --> 02:35:39.007
But never.

02:36:45.059 --> 02:36:49.033
The pilot doesn't have to take care of
stabilization of the system that that's done

02:36:49.033 --> 02:36:50.057
by automatic control system.

02:36:50.084 --> 02:36:56.009
What we have contributed, uh, is
autonomous aggressive maneuvering.

02:37:13.067 --> 02:37:18.001
The expanded research structure driven
by the vest administration was thriving and

02:37:18.005 --> 02:37:21.077
MIT's prestige continued to grow as
college admissions nationally became more

02:37:21.077 --> 02:37:26.005
competitive. President Vest fundraising
campaign was reaching new heights,

02:37:26.005 --> 02:37:30.025
raising money from aex of high net worth
individuals who had recently begun playing

02:37:30.025 --> 02:37:32.005
a larger role in MIT's financing.

02:37:53.006 --> 02:37:57.085
By the early two thousands, MIT was well
endowed with three core funding pipelines

02:37:58.036 --> 02:38:02.029
from the federal government, private
industry, and wealthy individuals.

02:38:02.083 --> 02:38:06.049
And as the government's financing
continue to wane the latitude,

02:38:06.049 --> 02:38:07.073
we're happy to fill in the gaps.

02:38:11.059 --> 02:38:12.001
One

02:38:12.001 --> 02:38:15.089
Of the great monuments of the modern
MIT is the Ray and Maria data Center,

02:38:16.073 --> 02:38:20.009
designed by a now architect, Frank
Gary, and built on top of building 20

02:38:23.068 --> 02:38:28.005
this data center housed the computer science
and artificial intelligence lab or sea

02:38:28.005 --> 02:38:32.089
sale, a merger between the laboratory
for computer science and Marvin Minsky's AI

02:38:32.089 --> 02:38:33.005
Lab.

02:38:34.073 --> 02:38:37.013
Frank wanted to try some new materials.

02:38:37.013 --> 02:38:39.057
He was enthralled over the
idea of building in Boston.

02:38:40.019 --> 02:38:42.021
You know, this building's largely brick.

02:38:42.090 --> 02:38:48.017
So he was quite invested in this building,
spent a lot of time understanding how

02:38:48.017 --> 02:38:51.001
the students and the faculty
live and work and what we need.

02:38:51.010 --> 02:38:55.027
He conceived this student's street idea
that would, would bring people together.

02:38:56.009 --> 02:39:01.027
But what the world was seeing in
the early days was the sort of, uh,

02:39:01.027 --> 02:39:04.051
helicopter view of photographs
and models and things.

02:39:04.051 --> 02:39:07.007
Believe me, a lot of people
didn't like what they saw.

02:39:09.094 --> 02:39:13.099
Well, it's, it's, it's a
very interesting building.

02:39:14.014 --> 02:39:15.071
You're in the state building.

02:39:15.071 --> 02:39:17.075
Yeah, it's right on top. Building 20.

02:39:17.075 --> 02:39:18.071
Used to be, but right.

02:39:19.062 --> 02:39:21.023
It's not really a place to work.

02:39:21.078 --> 02:39:23.015
I do my work at home, though

02:39:24.065 --> 02:39:29.027
The 300 million research facility was
funded by a number of wealthy MIT alumni.

02:39:30.072 --> 02:39:35.083
Besides waste data donors included
Moist Chang and Alexander Dryfus.

02:39:39.078 --> 02:39:43.027
Bill Gates also donated,
although he went to Harvard.

02:39:48.041 --> 02:39:52.012
At the height of this expansion, President
Vest announced one of the most

02:39:52.012 --> 02:39:53.076
revolutionary projects of his career.

02:39:56.046 --> 02:39:59.016
MIT Open Courseware, unlocking knowledge.

02:40:07.001 --> 02:40:13.028
In 2003, MIT launched Open Courseware
or O C W. The initiative released most of the

02:40:13.028 --> 02:40:16.000
institute's educational content
onto the internet for free.

02:40:16.037 --> 02:40:20.056
It was a groundbreaking step in the movement
for open access to education and the

02:40:20.056 --> 02:40:22.016
use of digital platforms for learning.

02:40:23.019 --> 02:40:26.080
Many professors and administrators thought
it would defeat the purpose of attending

02:40:26.090 --> 02:40:29.068
MIT in person, but vests
saw it differently.

02:40:37.008 --> 02:40:42.000
Meanwhile, MediaLab founder, Nicholas
Ponte, was also attempting to use the

02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:43.052
internet to make the
world a better place.

02:40:46.006 --> 02:40:48.012
One laptop per child, <laugh>.

02:40:48.012 --> 02:40:49.084
That's our name and our vision.

02:40:50.069 --> 02:40:54.044
We want to create educational opportunities
for the world's poorest children by

02:40:54.044 --> 02:40:58.036
providing each and everyone with a rugged
lowcost, low power connected laptop.

02:40:58.069 --> 02:41:01.028
No matter what language they
speak or where they live,

02:41:01.028 --> 02:41:05.048
the exo connects them to each other,
to the world, and to a brighter future.

02:41:05.094 --> 02:41:11.056
Why would a kid in the developing world
need a laptop of all things when they might

02:41:11.056 --> 02:41:15.096
not have food? They probably, some
cases don't live beyond the age of five.

02:41:15.096 --> 02:41:21.060
They don't have drinking water, uh, and
the parents earn a dollar a day or less.

02:41:22.059 --> 02:41:24.032
Good grief. Why should
they have a laptop?

02:41:26.095 --> 02:41:31.096
Take the word laptop and substitute
the word education, and nobody would say

02:41:31.096 --> 02:41:37.000
That. Bringing education to children all
over the world with one laptop per child.

02:41:46.053 --> 02:41:52.024
My fellow citizens at this hour, American
and coalition forces are in the early

02:41:52.024 --> 02:41:58.016
stages of military operations to disarm
Iraq, to free its people and to defend the

02:41:58.016 --> 02:41:59.024
world from grave danger.

02:42:00.021 --> 02:42:03.060
On my orders, coalition
forces have began striking,

02:42:03.060 --> 02:42:08.080
selected targets of military importance
to undermine Saddam Hussain's ability to

02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:09.032
wage war.

02:43:31.067 --> 02:43:37.070
In 2004, after 14 years of service, Chuck
Fest stepped down from the presidency.

02:43:40.012 --> 02:43:44.002
The task of appointing his successor
was a difficult one, and ultimately,

02:43:44.024 --> 02:43:48.062
the MIT Corporation selected another outsider
to continue the proliferation of the

02:43:48.062 --> 02:43:49.006
institute

02:43:54.012 --> 02:44:00.062
Put quite simply, I want MIT to be the
dream of every child who wants to make the

02:44:00.062 --> 02:44:01.038
world a better place.

02:44:04.074 --> 02:44:08.022
Susan Hockfield did an undergraduate
study at the University of Rochester,

02:44:08.022 --> 02:44:09.066
earning a degree in biology.

02:44:09.075 --> 02:44:14.054
In 1973, she continued to research career
at the Georgetown University's School of

02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:18.062
Medicine and became an NIH Postdoctoral
Fellow at the University of California,

02:44:18.086 --> 02:44:22.070
San Francisco. She worked as a research
scientist at the Cold Spring Harbor

02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:28.042
Laboratory for five years, and in 1985,
she joined the faculty at Yale serving as a

02:44:28.042 --> 02:44:30.094
professor until her appointment
as provost in 2003.

02:44:34.091 --> 02:44:38.074
In 2004, she was appointed
the 16th president of mit.

02:44:50.073 --> 02:44:56.050
I owe a second, and most profound thanks
to all the MIT presidents who have come

02:44:56.050 --> 02:44:56.550
before.

02:44:57.028 --> 02:45:00.012
Especially those who
are here with us today.

02:45:00.031 --> 02:45:04.052
Howard Johnson, Paul
Gray, and Chuck Vest.

02:45:05.002 --> 02:45:09.012
And I am immensely grateful to these three
great leaders for sharing with me their

02:45:09.012 --> 02:45:12.028
institutional insight and
their abiding love for MIT

02:45:15.004 --> 02:45:18.084
President Hockfield built on the momentum
set by the Vest administration without

02:45:18.084 --> 02:45:23.032
missing a beat, applying her unique
perspective as MIT's first president.

02:45:23.032 --> 02:45:27.032
With the background in the Life Sciences
Hawk Field expanded MIT's footprint in

02:45:27.032 --> 02:45:32.016
biology in 2006, course 20 was
redesignated as bioengineering.

02:45:32.034 --> 02:45:36.088
And in 2011, President Hockfield launched
the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer

02:45:37.032 --> 02:45:41.080
Research. A basic cancer research center
comprising over 50 laboratories and 1000

02:45:42.004 --> 02:45:42.504
researchers.

02:45:51.073 --> 02:45:56.079
All of you are, Hes to a legacy
of innovation, not just here,

02:45:56.079 --> 02:46:01.055
but across America that has improved
our health and our wellbeing and helped us

02:46:01.055 --> 02:46:03.055
achieve on parallel prosperity.

02:46:04.009 --> 02:46:10.027
You just get excited being here and seeing
these extraordinary young people, uh,

02:46:10.053 --> 02:46:15.075
and the extraordinary leadership
of Professor Hockfield, uh, because,

02:46:15.075 --> 02:46:18.095
because it taps into something
essential about America.

02:46:23.032 --> 02:46:26.051
In 2011, the final year
of her presidency,

02:46:26.059 --> 02:46:30.011
President Hockfield celebrated some
of the ultimate successes of her tenure.

02:46:31.021 --> 02:46:34.063
The opening of the Fairy Boys Massey
Hall marked the central achievement of

02:46:34.063 --> 02:46:36.007
Hockfield campaign for students.

02:46:36.049 --> 02:46:40.015
The new dormitory was actually a renovation
of one of the oldest buildings in

02:46:40.015 --> 02:46:44.051
Cambridge, a building older than campus
itself, which had been serving as a

02:46:44.067 --> 02:46:47.039
graduate student, residents
known as Ashtown until 2008.

02:46:49.002 --> 02:46:53.007
Like Simmons Hall Massey would
be designated as a tier one dorm,

02:46:53.042 --> 02:46:56.059
boasting some of the most sanitized
living conditions on campus.

02:46:57.057 --> 02:47:02.023
The renovation of Massey created
space for over 450 more undergraduates.

02:47:02.085 --> 02:47:07.011
2011 also marked 150 years
since the institute's founded.

02:47:07.053 --> 02:47:11.051
And just like any proud parent, President
Hawk Field celebrated by throwing a

02:47:11.051 --> 02:47:12.039
massive birthday party.

02:47:14.001 --> 02:47:14.099
Celebrations

02:47:14.099 --> 02:47:19.043
Included a convocation with 8,000
attendees and an outdoor art festival

02:47:19.043 --> 02:47:20.043
illuminating the campus.

02:47:24.044 --> 02:47:29.099
It was also an MIT open house, a free
public science fair with 20,000 visitors

02:47:29.099 --> 02:47:32.015
exploring innovation and
research across campus.

02:47:55.024 --> 02:48:00.000
As part of the centennial activities,
MIT also conducted a massive oral history

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.096
project, recording interviews with dozens
of longtime members of the MIT community

02:48:03.096 --> 02:48:05.088
and publishing them on
the internet for free.

02:48:07.008 --> 02:48:11.084
Professor Chomsky, thank you for talking
with us for this series of interviews

02:48:11.084 --> 02:48:15.012
being recorded for MIT's CSWE Centennial.

02:48:16.035 --> 02:48:23.016
You've been at MIT since 1955 for virtually
your whole career and for more than a

02:48:23.016 --> 02:48:24.064
third of MIT's existence.

02:48:26.033 --> 02:48:31.048
Is it still as hospitable a
place for you as it was then?

02:48:32.079 --> 02:48:34.092
Well, that's, it's, it's grown a lot.

02:48:35.001 --> 02:48:38.048
So in, in the mid fifties, you
kind of knew everybody, you know,

02:48:38.048 --> 02:48:43.020
so you had a question, you wanted
to talk to the provost, you know,

02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:44.080
he's a personal friend and so on.

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:49.020
But, uh, now it's, uh,
far for each individual.

02:48:49.023 --> 02:48:53.044
It's kind of more impersonal because
it's so much larger and more complex.

02:48:53.044 --> 02:48:59.000
But it remains, uh, it, in my experience,
pretty much same kind of place,

02:49:00.089 --> 02:49:03.064
Uh, as one man I can see.

02:49:03.075 --> 02:49:05.056
I wonder whatever happened to him.

02:49:06.061 --> 02:49:08.012
He was a very angry man.

02:49:09.097 --> 02:49:10.032
Uh,

02:49:12.053 --> 02:49:16.088
Despite only serving for eight years,
President Uckfield made a remarkable

02:49:16.088 --> 02:49:19.028
impression on the institute,
and under her leadership,

02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:23.008
MIT matured into the globally connected
temple of research that it is today.

02:49:24.081 --> 02:49:29.072
In 14 years, Chuck Vest
raised 3.5 billion in gifts.

02:49:30.024 --> 02:49:33.060
Susan Hockfield raised the
same amount in half the time,

02:49:34.022 --> 02:49:55.060
and a 10 saw the endowment expand
by 73% by the early 2010s,

02:49:55.082 --> 02:49:58.004
the terraforming of Cambridge
was in full force.

02:50:00.096 --> 02:50:06.039
In 2011, MIT received approval for a
700 million overhaul of its properties in

02:50:06.039 --> 02:50:10.023
Kendall Square. The eastern side of campus
known mostly for its parking lots and

02:50:10.023 --> 02:50:20.099
dilapidated factors. MIT's original plan
for expansion into Cambridge included only

02:50:20.099 --> 02:50:22.027
120 housing units.

02:50:22.097 --> 02:50:25.099
But in an echo of previous
conflicts with the community,

02:50:26.019 --> 02:50:33.015
local residents complained in response
to the demand for more housing in the area.

02:50:33.041 --> 02:50:36.071
The Hawk Field administration promised
that construction would include more luxury

02:50:36.071 --> 02:50:39.079
apartments and that MIT would
cultivate new life in the area.

02:50:41.025 --> 02:50:45.059
The overhaul was extremely successful,
and Kendall Square rapidly became a hub for

02:50:45.059 --> 02:50:49.011
big tech firms, biotech startups,
and pharmaceutical giants.

02:51:17.010 --> 02:51:19.050
MIT's campus was also experiencing
a turning point.

02:51:20.027 --> 02:51:25.074
In 2013, the iconic Bexley Hall sitting
directly across from the entrance of MIT

02:51:25.096 --> 02:51:31.046
had a problem. Its poorly maintained.

02:51:31.058 --> 02:51:34.098
Structure was becoming untenable, and
the administration was losing its patients.

02:51:35.087 --> 02:51:41.070
On May 7th, 2013 with final exams approaching,
MIT announced a three year closure

02:51:41.070 --> 02:51:43.018
of Bexley Hall for Innovations.

02:51:49.028 --> 02:51:52.094
The plan was to repair interior water
damage and other signs of age that render did

02:51:53.005 --> 02:51:53.098
unsafe to live.

02:51:53.098 --> 02:51:59.098
In Besley's 116 residents had two weeks
to prepare for their three year eviction

02:52:00.004 --> 02:52:02.054
and figure out how to preserve
this century old culture.

02:52:04.032 --> 02:52:07.078
But five months later, after initial
inspection of the building,

02:52:08.034 --> 02:52:11.078
MIT's department of facilities recommended
the total demolition of Bexley.

02:52:12.035 --> 02:52:16.010
In the administration's view, it was
too expensive to properly repair the dorm,

02:52:16.024 --> 02:52:18.050
and demolition would alleviate
many other headaches.

02:52:27.093 --> 02:52:31.098
Some report that during the demolition,
firefighters had to blast plumes of

02:52:31.098 --> 02:52:34.034
besley's dust and debris
away from the student center,

02:52:34.055 --> 02:52:37.062
as it likely contained asbestos
and countless other carcinogens.

02:52:56.093 --> 02:53:38.019
I can't believe he.

02:55:21.008 --> 02:55:25.087
In October, 2015, Bexley Park was established
in the place of the legendary dorm

02:55:27.006 --> 02:55:31.043
what was once an incubator for America's
counterculture and a hotbed for FBI.

02:55:31.043 --> 02:55:34.067
Investigations is now an additional
patch of green space.

02:55:38.009 --> 02:55:42.027
But when it came to major changes,
students had no reason to think that the

02:55:42.027 --> 02:55:43.023
administration would stop.

02:55:43.023 --> 02:55:47.039
At Bexley, MIT introduced new
regulations on student life,

02:55:47.042 --> 02:55:51.047
like heightened security at dormitory
entrances, mandatory approval of all parties

02:55:51.065 --> 02:55:53.063
and more patrols from the MIT police.

02:56:07.044 --> 02:56:12.031
In 2014, course 11, Professor Cynthia
Barnhart was appointed as chancellor,

02:56:13.017 --> 02:56:15.083
the primary authority
of a student life at mit.

02:56:16.061 --> 02:56:20.007
She often said that her priority
was the safety of all students.

02:56:23.054 --> 02:56:27.071
A few months into her administration,
she visited East Campus for a dinner with 60

02:56:27.071 --> 02:56:30.055
of its residents. In anticipation
of this meeting,

02:56:31.039 --> 02:56:33.067
residents and alumni of
Senior House, Random Hall,

02:56:33.074 --> 02:56:37.055
Bexley and East Campus came together
to create, this is East side,

02:56:37.090 --> 02:56:41.075
a collection of personal essays, treatises
and vignettes that offered a glimpse

02:56:41.075 --> 02:56:43.051
into MIT's most cultured dorms.

02:56:49.020 --> 02:56:53.019
Despite an out cry of love and support
for MIT's stranger dorms from students,

02:56:53.019 --> 02:56:56.055
alumni, and professors, the project
could not hold back the tide

02:56:58.098 --> 02:57:02.067
a new administration was forming, and
the trends of the past few decades were only

02:57:02.067 --> 02:57:03.015
accelerating.

02:57:07.075 --> 02:57:14.011
Sorry for interrupting, but I just
wanted to wish the class of 2013 a hardy

02:57:14.013 --> 02:57:16.099
congratulations on your
graduation from mit.

02:57:17.021 --> 02:57:21.039
You know, you were the first class that
I admitted as the Dean of Admissions,

02:57:21.067 --> 02:57:24.027
which makes you particularly special.

02:57:25.012 --> 02:57:30.043
We admitted you to MIT because we knew
that you were awesome and you were gonna do

02:57:30.043 --> 02:57:33.003
great things on our campus and beyond.

02:57:33.005 --> 02:57:36.059
And I wanna wish you well
as you go out into the world,

02:57:37.008 --> 02:57:39.079
be awesome and make the
world a better place.

02:57:54.089 --> 02:57:59.086
Well, the military is somewhat
under misunderstood.

02:57:59.089 --> 02:58:04.058
I think actually I'm a pretty
good position to know it.

02:58:04.058 --> 02:58:09.078
I've been at MIT for, I don't
know, 65 years, 60 years I guess,

02:58:10.020 --> 02:58:16.010
and MIT is a good example of one crucial
function to the military system.

02:58:16.079 --> 02:58:24.018
Uh, for many years, right into the 1970s,
MIT was almost a hundred percent funded

02:58:24.018 --> 02:58:30.038
by the Pentagon. Uh, it was also the main
academic center of resistance against the

02:58:30.038 --> 02:58:31.022
Vietnam War.

02:58:31.091 --> 02:58:35.026
Uh, my lab, in fact, was one
of the main academic centers.

02:58:36.009 --> 02:58:37.082
I was up for a long jail sentence.

02:58:38.020 --> 02:58:39.082
The Pentagon didn't give a damn.

02:58:40.023 --> 02:58:42.042
If you wanna overthrow the
country, that's your business.

02:58:42.042 --> 02:58:46.030
They don't care, you know, But what they
did give a damn about is they're creating

02:58:46.030 --> 02:58:48.038
the next phase of the high tech economy.

02:58:49.020 --> 02:58:54.034
The Pentagon was, and remains to
a large extent, a kind of a funnel, uh,

02:58:54.047 --> 02:58:59.035
but to which taxpayers poor
funds diluted into thinking.

02:58:59.035 --> 02:59:02.035
You know, we're defending ourselves
from whoever it may be,

02:59:02.085 --> 02:59:08.039
and the money goes into developing the,
uh, next phase of the high tech economy.

02:59:08.080 --> 02:59:14.015
So if you use a computer or you
use the internet, uh, uh, you know,

02:59:14.015 --> 02:59:18.011
you fly an airplane, which
is a modified bomber and so on,

02:59:18.046 --> 02:59:24.055
you're taking advantage of the role
of the dynamic state sector, of the

02:59:29.015 --> 02:59:31.027
Economy's dramatic facelifts of campus.

02:59:31.027 --> 02:59:34.091
And Cambridge would be continued by
President who for the first time since

02:59:34.091 --> 02:59:37.019
Paul Gray was an MIT insight.

02:59:40.028 --> 02:59:44.027
Raphael wife was born in Venezuela to
Jewish refugee parents who had fled the Nazi

02:59:44.027 --> 02:59:45.015
advance in Eastern Europe.

02:59:48.096 --> 02:59:52.067
He did his undergraduate study in
Venezuela at the University of Carbo,

02:59:52.067 --> 02:59:54.063
earning his degree in
electrical engineering.

02:59:54.063 --> 02:59:59.079
In 1973, he came to the United
States for graduate school.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.040
Earning a PhD from Stanford in 1979.

03:00:07.005 --> 03:00:11.000
In 1980, he joined the MIT faculty
as an assistant professor of electrical

03:00:11.020 --> 03:00:13.036
engineering receiving tenure in 1985.

03:00:14.093 --> 03:00:20.048
In 2004, he was named the Far Boy's Massey
Professor of Emerging Technology and was

03:00:20.048 --> 03:00:25.044
named Provost. A year later, he served
his provost at the Institute for seven

03:00:25.044 --> 03:00:30.080
years. And in 2012, Rafael wife was
appointed the 17th president of mit.

03:00:39.072 --> 03:00:43.028
Susan Hockfield passed the baton to
president right in a smooth transition of

03:00:43.028 --> 03:00:49.016
power. One of the first initiatives to
accelerate under the Rife administration was

03:00:49.036 --> 03:00:54.084
edX. edX was an evolved form of MIT X.
It was a partnership between MIT and Harvard

03:00:54.084 --> 03:00:58.048
to advance the goal of giving high quality
and free online education to users

03:00:58.048 --> 03:01:04.028
across the world. Today, edX has
grown to a cooperation between over 160

03:01:04.028 --> 03:01:07.024
institutions, and it has reached
tens of millions of students

03:01:07.048 --> 03:01:07.548
Globally.

03:01:17.006 --> 03:01:20.064
Administration was dedicated to strengthening
the entrepreneurial spirit of the

03:01:20.064 --> 03:01:28.020
modern mit. In 2016, MIT announced the
engine, a deep tech startup incubator,

03:01:28.020 --> 03:01:31.080
which provided portfolio companies with
both financial capital and access to the

03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:33.020
institute's advanced research labs

03:01:34.097 --> 03:01:35.064
Through

03:01:35.064 --> 03:01:39.020
The engine. MIT's fundamental research
could be more easily commercialized.

03:01:40.049 --> 03:01:46.008
In the same year, MIT launched Sandbox,
a program that supplied any MIT student or

03:01:46.008 --> 03:01:48.064
faculty member with mentorship
and cash for their new startup.

03:01:55.067 --> 03:02:00.068
2016 was an encouraging year for MIT's
future and also an important milestone in

03:02:00.068 --> 03:02:04.096
its history. Five years after
celebrating its 150th anniversary,

03:02:05.042 --> 03:02:06.084
MIT celebrated its centennial.

03:02:08.078 --> 03:02:12.072
MIT 2016 marked the hundredth anniversary
of MIT's move from Boston to Cambridge.

03:02:13.026 --> 03:02:16.040
The institute celebrated with special
events from February through June.

03:02:16.094 --> 03:02:20.020
One of the most notable events was
an open house held on April 23rd,

03:02:20.046 --> 03:02:22.044
one week after campus, PV weekend.

03:02:24.065 --> 03:02:27.056
It was similar to the open
house of the 2011 celebrations,

03:02:27.066 --> 03:02:29.068
but executed at an even larger scale.

03:02:30.017 --> 03:02:34.016
It was a science fair of science fairs,
a so-called Disneyland for nerds.

03:02:34.086 --> 03:02:39.060
For five hours on a Saturday, MIT opened
its doors to the public and 20,000

03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:42.064
visitors toward more than 150
labs and spaces around campus.

03:02:45.006 --> 03:02:50.040
Two weeks later, the campus celebrated
moving day, the flagship event of MIT 2016,

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:55.500
Somewhere

03:02:57.079 --> 03:02:58.064
Beyond the

03:02:58.064 --> 03:03:01.072
Sea reminiscent of the
original moving day.

03:03:01.072 --> 03:03:06.000
In 1916, the MIT community crossed from
Boston to Cambridge by various methods

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:10.088
Stands on golden watches.

03:03:10.088 --> 03:03:20.016
The ships somewhere the sea.

03:03:21.024 --> 03:03:23.096
She's there watching for me.

03:03:25.089 --> 03:03:28.012
If I could fly like birds,

03:03:30.059 --> 03:03:31.008
Then

03:03:31.028 --> 03:03:41.024
Straight to it's, they understand

03:03:42.046 --> 03:03:45.036
The festivities culminated on
May 7th with a toaster attack,

03:03:45.074 --> 03:03:49.044
the closing ceremony on Cleon Court through
with the MIT community coming together

03:03:49.044 --> 03:03:50.076
to celebrate MIT success.

03:03:51.073 --> 03:04:02.052
We a short from Boston to Cambridge of
360 1 4 suites plus minus one year journey

03:04:02.052 --> 03:04:05.024
from the industrial age
to the technology age,

03:04:05.035 --> 03:04:10.032
from a vocational school to a quality
technique university in the greatest research

03:04:10.032 --> 03:04:14.028
tradition, from a assortment
of buildings to the unified,

03:04:15.015 --> 03:04:23.028
from a local institution to a global,
from Boston Tech to Massachusetts Institutes

03:04:23.028 --> 03:04:23.528
technology.

03:04:29.070 --> 03:04:34.040
How about architectural genius
and Pritzker Prize winner I,

03:04:38.061 --> 03:04:40.004
Richard Fineman.

03:05:09.039 --> 03:05:14.074
In 2016, under President Life's Leadership,
MIT finally accomplished its mission.

03:05:15.052 --> 03:05:18.002
MIT had finally made a better world.

03:05:19.008 --> 03:05:22.039
The better World fundraising campaign
was President Re's continuation of the

03:05:22.039 --> 03:05:23.074
tradition set by his predecessors.

03:05:24.097 --> 03:05:28.090
Its aim was to supply the institute with
the funding necessary to secure its status

03:05:28.090 --> 03:05:30.063
as an elite global institution.

03:05:31.052 --> 03:05:36.018
The campaign was extremely successful,
raising $3 billion in five months.

03:05:37.048 --> 03:05:41.063
The funding provided resources for the
renovation of building nine and building two

03:05:46.068 --> 03:05:49.066
MIT Better World also enabled
the construction of W 97,

03:05:50.042 --> 03:06:13.014
building 12 and the new
MIT Museum Re's campaign.

03:06:13.014 --> 03:06:17.082
Also, boy, new initiatives and research
centers, including the Bennett W Go Center

03:06:17.082 --> 03:06:22.010
for Finance and Policy, the Hawk,
ean and Kay Lisa Young Center for Autism

03:06:22.039 --> 03:06:25.039
Research. The Abdu Latif
Jamil World Education Lab,

03:06:25.092 --> 03:06:28.050
The Abdu Latif Jamille Clinic
for Machine Learning and Health.

03:06:28.076 --> 03:06:30.098
And the Stephen a Schwarzman
College of Computing.

03:06:38.061 --> 03:06:42.039
MIT ended its 2017 academic year
with another massive celebration.

03:06:43.001 --> 03:06:47.035
One world at MIT was a festival showcasing
the diversity and talent within the MIT

03:06:47.035 --> 03:06:53.064
community. On a Saturday afternoon in
April, 1600 members of the community came

03:06:53.088 --> 03:06:56.067
together to watch performances from
student groups and cultural organizations.

03:06:59.051 --> 03:07:00.007
Later

03:07:00.007 --> 03:07:04.039
In the evening, the number of attendees
grew to 9,000 with students, faculty,

03:07:04.053 --> 03:07:07.059
and staff dancing together under
four culturally themed tents.

03:07:10.041 --> 03:07:14.080
The event was another resounding success,
and all levels of the MIT community

03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:19.023
looked forward to the second annual of
what students had begun to call 10 parties.

03:08:29.039 --> 03:08:34.066
So many people at mit, let me tell
you, MIT right now, y'all in a box.

03:08:36.001 --> 03:08:37.066
They have you in a box.

03:08:37.066 --> 03:08:41.066
You can save the world, but you are
working on things that are too small.

03:08:41.077 --> 03:08:46.078
Take a step back, Stop worrying about,
stop worrying about your college, uh,

03:08:46.078 --> 03:08:51.058
your loans. Stop worrying about what
job that they got waiting for you in Silicon

03:08:51.058 --> 03:08:53.026
Valley, mit.

03:08:53.026 --> 03:08:54.047
You can save the world.

03:08:54.081 --> 03:08:55.070
Kids in college.

03:08:55.070 --> 03:08:58.034
You could save the world. I'll put
my life on this interview right now.

03:08:58.069 --> 03:08:59.082
It's up to y'all.

03:08:59.082 --> 03:09:01.055
Y'all. The future, y'all.

03:09:01.055 --> 03:09:03.094
The future. But what y'all working
on right now working on,

03:09:03.094 --> 03:09:08.018
I'm working on this 3D printed thing
that is funded by, funded by Judo,

03:09:08.043 --> 03:09:09.074
Jeffrey Epstein.

03:09:16.003 --> 03:09:20.023
In September, 2019, the MIT Media
Lab was making national news.

03:09:22.032 --> 03:09:26.014
Its director at the time was Joey
Ito, a DJ turned entrepreneur,

03:09:26.014 --> 03:09:28.006
who had been leading the lab since 2011.

03:09:29.011 --> 03:09:32.058
He was excellent at communicating science
and technology to a general audience.

03:09:34.045 --> 03:09:37.006
Joey's the expert, so
I'm gonna defer to him.

03:09:37.039 --> 03:09:41.006
Uh, but my, my general
observation, as you said,

03:09:41.007 --> 03:09:46.026
is that it is seeping into our lives
in all sorts of ways that we just don't

03:09:46.026 --> 03:09:47.010
notice. Mm-hmm.

03:09:47.014 --> 03:09:50.094
<affirmative>, I feel like
this is the year that, uh,

03:09:50.094 --> 03:09:54.063
artificial intelligence becomes
not just the computer science problem,

03:09:54.081 --> 03:09:56.006
but something that.

03:09:56.030 --> 03:10:00.048
The White House that I, I've been
working very closely with a fryer in the

03:10:00.048 --> 03:10:03.095
Dominican order who's trying
to understand, um, you know,

03:10:03.095 --> 03:10:07.027
Bitcoin encryption and ai, um, from
the perspective of the Catholics.

03:10:07.027 --> 03:10:10.027
And so, so I think that, that a lot
of other people need to be involved,

03:10:10.027 --> 03:10:13.015
and the difficulty has been that
the computer science community,

03:10:13.016 --> 03:10:15.007
they're not an easy gang to talk to.

03:10:15.014 --> 03:10:19.019
And so, and I think, you know, the White
House here, your, your team and yourself.

03:10:19.019 --> 03:10:23.080
I, you've, you've probably gotten your
head around this more than any other, um,

03:10:23.084 --> 03:10:25.043
anybody else in, in history.

03:10:25.043 --> 03:10:28.064
And it's, it's good timing because
I think everybody needs to understand it.

03:10:28.064 --> 03:10:29.051
And I think that that's

03:10:29.057 --> 03:10:34.015
On August 15th, Joey Ito apologized to
the Media Lab community for his relationship

03:10:34.015 --> 03:10:37.083
with Jeff Leary Epstein for visiting
his estates and for allowing Epstein to

03:10:37.083 --> 03:10:41.027
contribute money to
the lab in recom Pence.

03:10:41.057 --> 03:10:45.072
He vowed to return the Epstein money
and to fundraised the equivalent amount to

03:10:45.072 --> 03:10:48.023
donate non-profits that help
survivors of sex trafficking.

03:10:49.022 --> 03:10:51.080
Ito claimed to have no knowledge
of Epstein's horrific crimes,

03:10:51.090 --> 03:10:55.075
and he ended his apology by inviting any
member of the Media Lab community to reach

03:10:55.075 --> 03:10:56.072
out to him directly.

03:10:58.010 --> 03:11:01.080
Within 45 minutes, a flowy
of emails came storming in.

03:11:03.086 --> 03:11:09.023
Some people challenged Joey Ito's apology
and claims of ignorance while others

03:11:09.023 --> 03:11:12.051
stood up for him and pointed fingers
at the system that allowed for a man like

03:11:12.051 --> 03:11:14.003
Jeffrey Epstein to get close to the lab.

03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:20.019
After a day, the discourse was moved to
a scheduled town hall meeting to be held in

03:11:20.019 --> 03:11:21.015
person at the media lab.

03:11:25.082 --> 03:11:30.011
Over time, it was revealed that Jeffrey
Epstein consistently visited the media lab

03:11:30.011 --> 03:11:33.035
throughout the 2010s to meet MIT's
top scientists and administrators.

03:11:37.003 --> 03:11:39.075
Epstein's presence at the media
lab was always difficult to hide.

03:11:40.025 --> 03:11:43.040
The conference rooms are made of
glass and meeting calendars are public.

03:11:44.027 --> 03:11:47.091
Peter Cohen, the director of the
Media Lab's funding and expansion,

03:11:47.098 --> 03:11:51.019
cooperated with ETO to conceal
Jeffrey Epstein's donations,

03:11:51.044 --> 03:11:54.015
mocking them as anonymous
and using the secret code.

03:11:54.025 --> 03:11:56.075
Jay, when mocking the
calendars for his visits.

03:12:05.036 --> 03:12:08.035
Jeffrey Epstein was a billionaire
child sex trafficker.

03:12:10.048 --> 03:12:14.032
He first entered the public eye in the
1990s when the media described him as a

03:12:14.032 --> 03:12:17.056
successful hedge fund manager who went
on lavish trips around the world with his

03:12:18.003 --> 03:12:26.057
friends. Epstein described himself
as a philanthropist of science.

03:12:29.007 --> 03:12:33.006
He offended the world's top academics
and innovators invited them to as many

03:12:33.006 --> 03:12:36.025
estates around the world, funding their
labs, and promoting their research.

03:12:38.028 --> 03:12:43.073
Marvin Minsky is a computer scientist,
and he is widely recognized as, uh,

03:12:43.073 --> 03:12:46.085
one of the founders, perhaps the
founder of artificial intelligence,

03:12:47.001 --> 03:12:49.009
cognitive science, and robotics.

03:12:49.050 --> 03:12:53.041
He is responsible among other things,
for the first neural network simulator,

03:12:53.041 --> 03:12:56.035
the first computer simulation
of semantic memory.

03:12:56.077 --> 03:13:00.056
But, uh, perhaps most significantly,
he was, uh,

03:13:00.056 --> 03:13:06.043
inspired Arthur C. Clark when he was,
uh, writing 2001 a Space Odyssey and served

03:13:06.052 --> 03:13:10.043
as consultant for that movie,
uh, in particular for the computer.

03:13:10.045 --> 03:13:16.003
How, uh, Marvin Minsky is Professor of
Media Arts and Sciences Emeritus at mit.

03:13:18.016 --> 03:13:21.023
Jeffrey Epstein was particularly
close with Marvin Minsky.

03:13:21.055 --> 03:13:26.007
They organized two academic conferences
together, one in 2002 on artificial

03:13:26.007 --> 03:13:29.015
intelligence and another
in 2012 on existential visc.

03:13:30.085 --> 03:13:34.040
The conference withheld on Epstein's
private island, Little St.

03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:40.032
James, Virginia.

03:13:40.032 --> 03:13:44.091
Jeffrey, a victim and survivor of Jeffrey
Epstein, later named Marvin Minsky.

03:13:44.091 --> 03:13:47.023
Among the powerful men, she
was directed to have sex with.

03:13:52.008 --> 03:13:52.508
Jeffrey

03:13:53.011 --> 03:13:55.011
Epstein went to jail just
before 10 this morning.

03:13:55.024 --> 03:13:56.095
He pleaded guilty in open court.

03:13:57.032 --> 03:14:00.083
He agreed to serve a total of 18 months
in the Palm Beach Detention Facility.

03:14:02.006 --> 03:14:06.011
MIT professor Seth Lloyd visited Epstein
as he served time in the Florida jail for

03:14:06.011 --> 03:14:08.048
quote, for curing a
child for prostitution.

03:14:08.088 --> 03:14:12.088
Lloyd later explained his students during
the lecture that Jeffrey Epstein was very

03:14:13.019 --> 03:14:20.019
charming. Epstein continued his philanthropy
work after his 2008 conviction,

03:14:20.030 --> 03:14:23.072
and by all accounts, he continued
to traffic young women and girls.

03:14:25.083 --> 03:14:30.023
According to MIT's official
report, between 2013 and 2017,

03:14:30.042 --> 03:14:33.064
Joey ETO and Seth Lloyd invited
Epstein to campus nine times.

03:14:35.018 --> 03:14:38.056
Professors who accepted Epstein's
gifts would present their work to him,

03:14:38.056 --> 03:14:41.088
discuss hard-hitting ideas, and
make plans for future patronage.

03:14:53.049 --> 03:14:57.059
The email states that Joey ETO invited
MIT undergraduates to meet with Jeffrey

03:14:57.088 --> 03:14:58.015
Epstein,

03:15:00.069 --> 03:15:01.059
Billionaire

03:15:01.083 --> 03:15:05.064
Businessman, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested
in New York Saturday on federal charges

03:15:05.064 --> 03:15:07.015
related to sex trafficking.

03:15:07.030 --> 03:15:11.048
The 66 year old hedge fund manager
has long been accused of sexually abusing

03:15:11.048 --> 03:15:12.040
underage girls.

03:15:12.073 --> 03:15:17.083
In 2007, he pleaded guilty to two prostitution
counts in Florida as part of a

03:15:17.083 --> 03:15:22.080
controversial deal to avoid federal charges,
he was sentenced to 13 months in jail.

03:15:23.033 --> 03:15:26.032
MIT is facing more backlash
from its own staff.

03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:30.003
After it was revealed, the school
took money from Jeffrey Epstein.

03:15:30.032 --> 03:15:34.032
At least two high profile researchers
have reportedly announced plans to resign in

03:15:34.032 --> 03:15:34.532
protests.

03:15:37.008 --> 03:15:42.015
On September 4th, 2019, the media lab
held a town hall to address the growing

03:15:42.015 --> 03:15:48.032
scandal. Professors, administrators, graduate
students, and MIT undergrads gathered

03:15:48.032 --> 03:15:51.080
to hear from Nicholas Negroponte,
the founder of the Media Lab himself.

03:15:52.097 --> 03:15:57.027
He also had a decade long relationship
with Jeffrey Epstein and was known to have

03:15:57.027 --> 03:15:58.059
flown on Epstein's private jet,

03:15:59.007 --> 03:16:07.007
A building full of interdisciplinary
people who all had as a common vision making

03:16:07.007 --> 03:16:08.027
the world a better place.

03:16:11.040 --> 03:16:14.080
At the end of the Town Hall,
Nego Ponte reminded his audience,

03:16:15.013 --> 03:16:18.043
If you wind back the clock,
I would still say Take it.

03:16:29.063 --> 03:16:34.023
Upon further investigation, MIT revealed
that President Rafael Life signed a thank

03:16:34.023 --> 03:16:38.056
you note to Jeffrey Epstein In 2012, after
Epstein donated another six figure gift

03:16:38.056 --> 03:16:39.056
to Professor Seth Lloyd.

03:16:40.073 --> 03:16:43.003
It was the sixth week
of life's presidency.

03:16:49.065 --> 03:16:53.015
In exchange for their support, the federal
government and private corporations

03:16:53.015 --> 03:16:55.080
largely seek MIT's intellectual
property and talent.

03:16:58.068 --> 03:16:59.035
However,

03:16:59.085 --> 03:17:02.067
The quid pro quo for wealthy
individuals is more personal.

03:17:03.003 --> 03:17:06.011
Which donors of MIT get to
share the institute's prestige.

03:17:06.055 --> 03:17:10.048
They are invited to attend MIT's galas,
and they rub shoulders with top professors.

03:17:12.025 --> 03:17:16.059
MIT has an entire administrative apparatus
to celebrate and appease these donors

03:17:16.083 --> 03:17:18.095
whose intentions may vary wildly.

03:17:21.080 --> 03:17:23.098
At the time of the controversy
at the Media Lab,

03:17:24.005 --> 03:17:26.055
the new facility was only
about seven years old.

03:17:27.024 --> 03:17:30.078
The hundred million building was
designed by a noun Japanese architect,

03:17:30.078 --> 03:17:35.007
Fujiko Maki, and was constructed as a
direct extension of the Media Lab's original

03:17:35.007 --> 03:17:37.039
Reasoner building designed by imp.

03:17:39.053 --> 03:17:42.075
The building is also about
65 feet from Senior House.

03:17:47.023 --> 03:17:51.035
Senior House was MIT's first
dormitory established in 1916.

03:17:52.024 --> 03:17:57.015
Similar to Bexley Hall, Senior House
was filled with mules lo and tradition.

03:17:57.065 --> 03:18:02.015
However, unlike Bexley, the senior
house building was in fine shape,

03:18:02.077 --> 03:18:06.023
but the new administration was increasingly
unhappy with senior house students

03:18:09.005 --> 03:18:10.023
in June, 2016.

03:18:10.048 --> 03:18:14.040
As both MIT and Senior House wrapped
up their centennial Chancellor,

03:18:14.040 --> 03:18:16.003
Cynthia Barnhardt made an announcement.

03:18:16.059 --> 03:18:20.011
After extensive research, data
collection and committee meetings,

03:18:20.034 --> 03:18:23.059
Barnhart announced that no freshman would
be allowed to move into senior house in

03:18:23.059 --> 03:18:24.056
the fall of 2016.

03:18:28.057 --> 03:18:30.024
She revealed some concerning statistics.

03:18:30.094 --> 03:18:35.091
From 2004 to 20 15, 80 4% of MIT students
earned their undergraduate degree in four

03:18:35.091 --> 03:18:38.064
years, and just 7.5% dropped out.

03:18:39.022 --> 03:18:41.083
But for students who began their
freshman year in senior house,

03:18:41.098 --> 03:18:46.064
the four year graduation rate was
only 60%, and the dropout rate was 21%.

03:18:49.050 --> 03:18:53.075
Barnhart also cited credible concerns
of illegal drug use at Senior House and her

03:18:53.075 --> 03:18:56.019
genital sense that it was an
unsafe environment for students.

03:19:01.059 --> 03:19:05.040
After massive outcry from students and
alumni for this potentially fatal blow to

03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:08.003
senior house, the tech printed
the administration's response.

03:19:09.049 --> 03:19:11.099
The chancellor states that
this is not a punitive measure.

03:19:12.002 --> 03:19:16.015
Rather, it is a move to support dorm
residents and foster academic success and

03:19:16.015 --> 03:19:20.019
community wellbeing. Cynthia Barnhardt
promised to work with the senior house

03:19:20.019 --> 03:19:23.035
community to address these disparities
and solve the senior house problem.

03:19:26.009 --> 03:19:29.072
She assembled a working group of
47 student leaders, faculty members,

03:19:30.056 --> 03:19:33.088
graduate residents, and administrators
to spark a turnaround for senior house.

03:19:37.022 --> 03:19:40.043
But in the spring 2017
semester, the tone shifted.

03:19:40.098 --> 03:19:43.064
The turnaround meeting suddenly
ended, and instead,

03:19:43.064 --> 03:19:46.056
the MIT administration began
a closed door formal review.

03:19:47.098 --> 03:19:52.015
The chancellor's staff interrogated every
resident of Senior House individually

03:19:52.015 --> 03:19:53.083
with no legal representation.

03:19:56.013 --> 03:19:59.080
By the end of the semester, five Senior
House sophomores face disciplinary.

03:20:00.006 --> 03:20:04.060
For legal drug activity, allegedly having
purchased bulk orders of cocaine via the

03:20:04.060 --> 03:20:09.048
dark net. Coincidentally, the tour
project, which maintains the dark net,

03:20:09.070 --> 03:20:11.056
was created by an alum of senior house.

03:20:13.062 --> 03:20:17.052
The crackdown continued, the
administration shut down stairs,

03:20:17.069 --> 03:20:21.016
an annual festival where countless senior
house alumni were turned to their former

03:20:21.016 --> 03:22:40.036
home. In June, 2017, Barnhart's
committee announced Pilots 2021,

03:22:40.071 --> 03:22:44.048
a new program where all residents of senior
House must be formally admitted by the

03:22:44.048 --> 03:22:45.032
MIT administration.

03:22:46.073 --> 03:22:50.016
It was simply too dangerous to allow
senior house's culture to continue.

03:22:50.053 --> 03:22:54.000
So the Chancellor's Office attempted
to create an entirely new one from scratch,

03:22:54.032 --> 03:22:57.084
built on the principles of career
exploration, food and cooking,

03:22:58.006 --> 03:22:59.060
and mind and body wellness.

03:23:11.018 --> 03:23:12.068
The crowd was into it.

03:23:12.088 --> 03:23:16.032
There was lots of sweets and mugs.

03:23:16.032 --> 03:23:18.040
So overall, great event

03:23:37.093 --> 03:23:40.068
Fizzled out, but the result was final.

03:23:41.031 --> 03:23:42.068
Senior house was dead.

03:23:42.070 --> 03:23:43.012
I'm

03:23:43.012 --> 03:23:44.016
Gonna lose it.

03:23:46.056 --> 03:23:48.000
Substance abuse.

03:23:48.097 --> 03:23:53.036
In the fall of 2017, MIT announced
that senior house would be converted into

03:23:53.036 --> 03:23:54.052
housing for graduate students.

03:23:55.003 --> 03:23:58.068
From then onward, it would
be known as 70 Amherst Street.

03:24:00.074 --> 03:24:04.060
The national media viewed this saga as
yet another turning point in university's

03:24:04.060 --> 03:24:08.000
lurch towards total safety
Wired magazine contended.

03:24:08.010 --> 03:24:11.012
The knowledge economy means people
need more and more schooling,

03:24:11.012 --> 03:24:13.044
which in turn extends the
length of adolescence.

03:24:13.099 --> 03:24:17.092
This has led to a trend of administration's
attempting to control every aspect of

03:24:17.092 --> 03:24:21.072
student's lives. It sets up a
naturally combative relationship,

03:24:21.072 --> 03:24:25.008
especially in an environment
as academically difficult as mit.

03:24:25.095 --> 03:24:28.052
It's you, the student against the I.

03:24:29.083 --> 03:24:32.082
Uh, it used to be the students were
in charge of absolutely everything.

03:24:32.092 --> 03:24:37.042
The students were the desk workers who
did security, did packages, sold stamps,

03:24:37.042 --> 03:24:41.002
sold soda, you know, whatever, rented
out movies, whatever they wanted.

03:24:41.027 --> 03:24:44.058
Uh, students were in charge of keeping,
uh, kitchens cleaned, you know,

03:24:44.058 --> 03:24:48.038
in charge of a lot more around
the dorm than they currently are.

03:24:48.066 --> 03:24:52.018
Like one by one, like responsibility
is being taken away.

03:24:52.018 --> 03:24:55.034
Students these days have to jump
through so many hoops to do anything.

03:24:55.034 --> 03:24:59.090
There's, there's, there's so much liability
that they have to worry about that we

03:24:59.090 --> 03:25:01.018
just did not worry about.

03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:02.022
And

03:25:02.050 --> 03:25:05.077
Drinking the destruction of senior house
left the east side with just two dorms,

03:25:05.089 --> 03:25:07.066
Random Hall and East Campus.

03:25:08.036 --> 03:25:12.045
And a clock was ticking on the west
side of campus where Burton was physically

03:25:12.045 --> 03:25:19.042
crumbling. Years after the
closure of senior house,

03:25:20.003 --> 03:25:23.045
MIT announced that East Campus and,
but would be shut down for maintenance.

03:25:27.052 --> 03:25:28.002
Each

03:25:28.002 --> 03:25:32.010
Round of maintenance comes with inia
of meals and to have placements to the dorms

03:25:32.010 --> 03:25:33.066
foundation,
There's a new dorm going up.

03:25:33.092 --> 03:25:37.030
And as soon as that's ready, as soon
as the other renovations and other dorms are

03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:39.061
done, they're gonna renovate East Campus
and they're gonna renovate it out of

03:25:39.061 --> 03:25:42.038
existence. The building may still
exist, it might still be a dorm,

03:25:42.038 --> 03:25:44.094
but they are going to make sure
that you're not painting murals,

03:25:44.094 --> 03:25:48.034
you're not modifying any portion, you're
not knocking holes in the wall to put in a

03:25:48.034 --> 03:25:50.061
fish tank. You know, you're not,
you're not doing any of the things.

03:25:50.061 --> 03:25:54.058
You're not given the freedom to express
yourself that the East side culture

03:25:54.069 --> 03:25:55.038
requires.

03:26:01.067 --> 03:26:06.002
There's so much variety
and so much choice, um,

03:26:06.002 --> 03:26:07.094
and so much independence for students.

03:26:08.039 --> 03:26:13.058
Uh, and I think that's like
very much linked to MIT's values,

03:26:13.064 --> 03:26:20.042
and I hope that people come to realize
that, who, uh, have control over, um,

03:26:20.042 --> 03:26:21.014
their future.

03:27:15.031 --> 03:27:18.061
In fall 2018, MIT Nano opened its doors.

03:27:19.032 --> 03:27:22.061
The 400 million facility was
itself an engineering marvel.

03:27:22.088 --> 03:27:26.018
And just like how the data center was
a commitment to computer science research,

03:27:26.064 --> 03:27:30.014
MIT Nano embodies the institute's commitment
to the future of nanotechnology

03:27:44.043 --> 03:27:45.090
Located on our third floor.

03:27:46.002 --> 03:27:50.030
The MIT Nano Immersion Lab is an environment
developing new software and hardware

03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:51.094
concepts for immersive experiences.

03:27:58.064 --> 03:28:03.002
Two weeks after MIT Nanos grand opening
president wife announced the Stephen a

03:28:03.002 --> 03:28:06.042
Schwarzman College of Computing wis
office called it the most significant

03:28:06.053 --> 03:28:08.050
restructuring of MIT in 70 years.

03:28:09.027 --> 03:28:12.074
My intent with this gift is
to make the world a better place

03:28:17.019 --> 03:28:20.030
Founded
On slavery and colonialism.

03:28:22.059 --> 03:28:27.069
At mit, we take very seriously at responsibility
to prepare our students to be

03:28:27.069 --> 03:28:33.058
leaders, and to be leaders in addressing
and solving the most important challenges

03:28:33.064 --> 03:28:34.082
the world is facing.

03:28:35.035 --> 03:28:39.018
We have done that for generations,
and we will continue to do that.

03:28:39.018 --> 03:28:43.042
And now more than ever, we need to prepare
students to understand the ethics and

03:28:43.061 --> 03:28:46.058
societal implications of these
technology and these advancements.

03:28:46.058 --> 03:28:47.076
And
We're in a unique.

03:28:48.005 --> 03:28:51.013
In history, but we actually can do those

03:28:51.013 --> 03:28:51.513
Things.

03:28:53.042 --> 03:28:58.013
The college established 50 new endowed
faculty chairs and it further solidified

03:28:58.025 --> 03:29:01.044
MIT's devotion to computation
and artificial intelligence.

03:29:02.069 --> 03:29:05.020
Hi, I'm Russell, and this is Spa.

03:29:09.027 --> 03:29:09.527
It's

03:29:20.050 --> 03:29:25.049
Hi everybody, and welcome to S 1 91.

03:29:48.100 --> 03:30:29.009
I am, um,

03:30:37.038 --> 03:30:41.097
On Thursday, March 5th, 2020, the Coronavirus
had established itself in the

03:30:41.097 --> 03:30:46.073
United States. However, the MIT administration
considered its risk to the campus

03:30:46.073 --> 03:30:49.009
community to be low, but just to be safe,

03:30:49.050 --> 03:30:52.060
MIT prohibited all social gatherings
of 150 people or more.

03:30:53.032 --> 03:30:55.097
That policy even applied
to campus preview weekend,

03:30:56.000 --> 03:30:58.000
which would be converted
to a virtual format.

03:30:59.003 --> 03:31:01.081
Course instruction, however,
would continue as normal.

03:31:04.034 --> 03:31:10.000
On Tuesday, March 10th, 2020, the administration
took a significant new step in

03:31:10.025 --> 03:31:14.000
response to the virus requiring all
students to evacuate campus within a week.

03:31:15.082 --> 03:31:19.005
At the time there were 92
confirmed a presumptive covid,

03:31:19.036 --> 03:31:20.068
19 cases in the state of Massachusetts.

03:31:24.061 --> 03:31:30.073
On that day, thousands of students realized
that their MIT was gone and they had no

03:31:30.073 --> 03:31:31.097
idea if it would come back.

03:32:09.088 --> 03:32:16.009
80 years, 100,000 alumni,
trillions of dollars.

03:32:18.016 --> 03:32:20.084
What started as an idea
to better the world?

03:32:20.084 --> 03:32:23.033
Through technology has
become the gold standard.

03:32:24.061 --> 03:32:28.020
Through the tireless work of generations
of extremely talented people,

03:32:29.002 --> 03:32:33.005
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
has grown from a patch of dirt into a

03:32:33.005 --> 03:32:40.025
city on a river. And yet, with all
our talent and all our resources,

03:32:40.067 --> 03:32:44.089
the Covid Pandemic brought this
institute to a halt already,

03:32:45.063 --> 03:32:49.073
MIT has demonstrated remarkable resilience,
and it is clear that the institute will

03:32:49.073 --> 03:32:50.009
survive,

03:32:51.034 --> 03:32:52.052
But it will not survive.

03:32:52.052 --> 03:32:57.005
Unchanged living groups and student clubs
do not have billion dollar endowments.

03:32:57.049 --> 03:32:58.084
Which of them will survive?

03:32:59.067 --> 03:33:02.049
And if they die, what
traditions will we lose?

03:33:03.056 --> 03:33:04.005
What

03:33:04.005 --> 03:33:07.065
Will take their place as students
return to their labs?

03:33:08.011 --> 03:33:11.005
What research will we conduct
and who will fund it?

03:33:12.035 --> 03:33:19.002
As we recover our balance and march on
with the progress, who is MIT going to be?
